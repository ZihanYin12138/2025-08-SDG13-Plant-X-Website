          How Climate change threatens on Australian Plants
          <small></small>
        </h3>
        <h1><a href="https://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/nearly-half-of-australias-native-plants-are-under-threat-from-climate-change/eotnh8c3f ">(i) Plants are suffering from excessive heat</a></h1>
        <p>
            47% of Australia's native plant species may face challenges by 2070 as temperatures rise. 
            Plants that have survived in stable conditions for thousands of years are now at risk of dying because they cannot tolerate the extreme heat.
        </p>
        <h1><a href="https://www.nespthreatenedspecies.edu.au/news-and-media/latest-news/race-to-unlock-secret-to-save-endangered-orchids ">(ii) Rainfall patterns are changing</a></h1>
        <p>
            Unpredictable rainfall disrupts natural cycles that provide water to plants. 
            Many species are under stress and struggling to adapt to conditions very different from what they are accustomed to.
        </p>
        <h1><a href="https://theconversation.com/the-50-beautiful-australian-plants-at-greatest-risk-of-extinction-and-how-to-save-them-160362 ">(iii) Species can be wiped out by one bad storm</a></h1>
        <p>
            A single severe storm can destroy an entire species. 
            Approximately 33 threatened species exist in just one location, so a bushfire or a big storm could end their existence. 
        </p>
        <h1><a href="">(iv) Plant partnerships that took millions of years are crumbling</a></h1>
        <p>
            Many orchids rely on fungi in their roots to survive. 
            Climate change is disrupting these vital relationships, threatening species that have evolved over millions of years.

        <h1><a href="https://theconversation.com/australia-first-research-reveals-staggering-loss-of-threatened-plants-over-20-years-151408 ">(v) Plants do not receive fire when they need it</a></h1>
        <p>
            Fire is essential for seed germination in many Australian plants. 
            However, altered fire patterns now prevent reproduction, leaving some species unable to regenerate.

          How Your Garden Supports Nature in a Changing Climate
          <small></small>

        <h1><a href="https://conservationvolunteers.com.au/australias-endangered-plants-and-animals-creating-nature-blocks-to-save-them/ ">(i) Turn Your Backyard Into a Wildlife Highway</a></h1>
        <p>
            Planting native species can transform suburban gardens into vital habitats, linking fragmented landscapes. 
            This creates safe corridors for wildlife to move between natural areas 
        </p>
        <h1><a href="https://www.gardeningaustraliamag.com.au/growing-australian-native-plants/ ">(ii) Provide food and shelter for wildlife</a></h1>
        <p>
            Native plants such as banksias, grevilleas, and bottlebrush supply essential food for bees, birds, and small mammals. At the same time, 
            gardens offer safe shelter and passageways, helping endangered species survive and move between fragmented environments.
        </p>
        <h1><a href="https://www.rbg.vic.gov.au/science/research/orchid-conservation-program/ ">(iii) Seeds and Genetic Diversity Matter</a></h1>
        <p>
            Growing a variety of native plants preserves genetic diversity, which is critical for species survival. 
            With this practice, your garden becomes a valuable seed bank, strengthening resilience in wild populations.
        </p>

        <p>
            Native plants sustain vital relationships with pollinators like bees and birds, ensuring ecological interactions that are essential for reproduction and biodiversity.
        </p>
        <h1><a href="https://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/nearly-half-of-australias-native-plants-are-under-threat-from-climate-change/eotnh8c3f ">(v) Plants help climate change adaption</a></h1>
        <p>
            Cultivating endangered species in different environments helps them adapt to changing conditions, enabling resilience as climate zones shift.
