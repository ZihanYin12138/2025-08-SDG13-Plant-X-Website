            <p>
                47% of Australia's native plant species may face challenges by 2070 as temperatures rise. 
                Plants that have survived in stable conditions for thousands of years are now at risk of dying because they cannot tolerate the extreme heat.

            <p>
                Unpredictable rainfall disrupts natural cycles that provide water to plants. 
                Many species are under stress and struggling to adapt to conditions very different from what they are accustomed to.

            <p>
                A single severe storm can destroy an entire species. 
                Approximately 33 threatened species exist in just one location, so a bushfire or a big storm could end their existence.

            <p>
                Many orchids rely on fungi in their roots to survive. 
                Climate change is disrupting these vital relationships, threatening species that have evolved over millions of years.

            <p>
                Fire is essential for seed germination in many Australian plants. 
                However, altered fire patterns now prevent reproduction, leaving some species unable to regenerate.
