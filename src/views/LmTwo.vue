            <p>
                Planting native species can transform suburban gardens into vital habitats, linking fragmented landscapes. 
                This creates safe corridors for wildlife to move between natural areas

            <h1><a href="https://www.gardeningaustraliamag.com.au/growing-australian-native-plants/ ">(ii) Provide food and shelter for wildlife</a></h1>
            <p>
                Native plants such as banksias, grevilleas, and bottlebrush supply essential food for bees, birds, and small mammals. At the same time, 
                gardens offer safe shelter and passageways, helping endangered species survive and move between fragmented environments.

            <p>
                Growing a variety of native plants preserves genetic diversity, which is critical for species survival. 
                With this practice, your garden becomes a valuable seed bank, strengthening resilience in wild populations.
