  "description": "Bush's sedge (Carex bushii) is an amazing species for its low maintenance and stunning ornamental appeal. This species is easy to care for and can make a great addition to almost any outdoor space. Bush's sedge grows in a direct clump and is great for providing texture and screening. The foliage is deep green with bronze tones that get brighter in the sun and really sparkle. Bush's sedge can also tolerate periods of drought yet still be able to thrive in humid climates. This sedge is a deer resistant plant that adds personality and charm with its elegant arching stems and texture. Its truly an amazing plant you don't want to miss out on.",
