  "description": "The red maple (Acer rubrum 'Brandywine') is an amazing species known for its beautiful fall foliage and strong, hardy growth. This variety of red maple displays a vibrant, purplish-red color during the fall season and produces eye-catching clusters of small, bright red flowers in the spring. Its rapid growth allows it to reach heights of up to 80 feet and its wide, lower branches are ideal for providing shade in summer and protection during winter winds. Its dark green, pointy leaves offer an evergreen beauty during the harsh winter season, set off by heavy clusters of small samaras during the summer. This beautiful and hardy species is sure to add a real statement to any landscape.",
