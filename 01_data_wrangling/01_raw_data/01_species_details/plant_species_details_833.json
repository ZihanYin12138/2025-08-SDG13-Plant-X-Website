  "description": "Thimbleweed (Anemone virginiana) is an amazing plant species due its wide range of adaptations. Its bright white clusters of flowers form in the late summer and autumn and last into the early winter. These flowers form from a single plant that can spread up to five feet in diameter. Its deeply divided leaves create a distinctive look and attract many pollinators. As a perennial species, thimbleweed blooms year-round and is extremely resilient, tolerating various soil and moisture conditions. Additionally, its perfectly round, thimble-shaped fruit offers winter and early spring-time food for birds and other wildlife. Thimbleweed is an incredible species that can be seen in many areas and is a beautiful addition to any garden.",
