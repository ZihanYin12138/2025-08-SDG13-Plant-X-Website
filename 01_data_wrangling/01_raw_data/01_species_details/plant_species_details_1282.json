  "description": "River Birch (Betula nigra 'BNMTF' DURA-HEAT) is an amazing tree species perfect for any garden! It's heat tolerant, fast growing and provides much-needed shade in the summer. Its deep, fissured bark has been known to add beauty and texture with its cinnamon hue. It looks particularly stunning when planted near bodies of water, such as rivers and lakes. Its leathery leaves change from deep green in spring and summer, to yellow and golden hues in winter. River birches are also incredibly multi-tasker and can even be used as a privacy screen or border. With its adaptability to harsh conditions, it makes for an ideal, long-term investment for anyone's garden.",
