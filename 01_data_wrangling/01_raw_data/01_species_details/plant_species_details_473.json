  "description": "Alps yarrow (Achillea distans) is an amazing plant species because itâ€™s incredibly hardy and drought-tolerant. It has small, fern-like leaves and pretty, white flower heads made up of many tiny florets held up on slender stems. No matter what altitude it's grown at, it can survive and make a great addition to gardens and rockeries. It's disease-resistant as well, and it looks great with other perennials that thrive in alpine gardens. Plus, it's easy to propagate by division. It's a hardy, reliable and low-maintenance groundcover that's sure to make any garden look lush.",
