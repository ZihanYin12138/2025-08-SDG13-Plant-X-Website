  "description": "Mikazuki Japanese Maple is an amazing ornamental species with its striking foliage. The leaves are relatively small, deep green in color with creamy white edges, which makes it ideal for creating a statement piece in any garden. Due to its slow growth rate, it can also be used as a bonsai species making it a great choice for those experienced in bonsai cultivation. During summer, it has bright pink flowers, and in the fall, the leaves turn a gorgeous red, making it a great choice for anyone looking to add some dazzling color to their landscaping. Despite its delicate looks, Mikazuki is hardy and easy to maintain, making it perfect for both beginners and seasoned gardeners.",
