  "description": "The custard apple (Annona reticulata) is a unique and amazing species of fruit. The outside of the fruit is green and has a bumpy, almost spiny look, while the inside is creamy and sweet. The white flesh of the fruit has a creamy, custard-like texture and a sweet flavour. The custard apple is packed with essential vitamins and minerals, making it a great source of nutrition. Because of its easy portability, it's perfect for taking on picnics or days out. Additionally, the custard apple can also be used to make jams, jellies and sauces, as well as being great for smoothies. With its unique flavour, creamy texture and nutritional benefits, it's no surprise that the custard apple is a popular choice among fruit lovers.",
