  "description": "River birch (Betula nigra 'Dickinson' Northern Tribute) is an amazing plant species with many desirable characteristics. It is a fast-growing medium to large tree with beautiful exfoliating, cinnamon-tan bark and drooping foliage that becomes more pendulous with age. In addition, it is highly tolerant of adverse growing conditions such as pollution, poor soils, and heat. It is also a great choice for those looking for year-round interest in the landscape since its attractive bark will persist even when there are no leaves on the tree. This hardy tree is especially popular in the Midwestern and Southern parts of the United States and is commonly used for restoration and beautification projects.",
