  "description": "Fox Sedge is an amazing plant species that is both attractive and incredibly useful. It's known for its lovely clumping habit and delicate, waving culms, plus it brings multiple season enjoyment to your landscape with its quiet golden-yellow blooms in summer and unique reddish seed heads in winter. This native perennial is surprisingly drought tolerant and prefers slightly acidic soils, as well as wet areas like pond and stream edges. It is an important source of food for beneficial insects including ladybugs, bees, and butterflies, and provides shelter for voles and birds. In short, Fox Sedge is an attractive, unique, and ecologically beneficial wildflower that can fit into any landscape.",
