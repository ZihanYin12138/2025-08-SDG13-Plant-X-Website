  "description": "The Katsura Japanese Maple is an amazing deciduous tree that offers a rainbow of vibrant colors during each season. In late spring, its delicate five-lobed leaves emerge a soft orange-red hue that matures to a deep green by mid-summer. During fall, its leaves turn a brilliant mix of orange and yellow, and its sprawling branches often take on unique shapes that are amazing to behold. It’s also a low-maintenance variety, making it ideal for welcoming new gardeners with no prior experience. Looks aside, it’s also a tough variety, able to withstand temperatures into the mid 20s. It’s no wonder this tree has been a favorite among gardeners for centuries.",
