  "description": "The Hornbeam Maple is an amazing species to admire for many reasons. It is a great tree for planting in urban areas due to its low-maintenance characteristics. It is known for its lush, green foliage that turns a yellowish-golden color during fall. It is also an incredibly hardy tree and can successfully tolerate most environmental conditions and urban settings. The tree can also withstand some drought and moisture. Its distinctive, mottled bark also adds special interest and enhances the overall beauty of the landscape. This deciduous tree can reach up to 25 feet height at maturity and is fast-growing. With its unique beauty and favorable attributes, it's no surprise why the Hornbeam Maple has become a popular choice for urban settings.",
