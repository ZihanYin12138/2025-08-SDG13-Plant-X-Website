  "description": "Fringed Sedge (Carex crinita) is an amazing plant species that adapts to Wetland and Lowland forest habitat with ease. It is a perennial, cool-season native grass that is capable of providing four-season interest in southwestern landscapes. Its delicate-looking, evergreen leaves have a soft, billowy texture that contrasts nicely with other plant species. In summer, fringed sedge produces inconspicuous, feathery flower spikes that add subtle beauty. In winter, its evergreen leaves make a welcome addition to the garden, and its fuzzy yellow-brown seed heads provide valuable winter food for wildlife. It is a highly adaptable species and is very low maintenance.",
