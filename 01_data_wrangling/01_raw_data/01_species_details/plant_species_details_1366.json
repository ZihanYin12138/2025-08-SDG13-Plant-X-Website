  "description": "The butterfly bush (Buddleja davidii) is an amazing plant species because of its beauty and its ability to attract butterflies. This species of bush has vibrant clusters of fragrant flowers that range in colour from white, pink, purple and blue. When these flowers are in full bloom, they are truly a sight to behold. Not only are they stunningly beautiful, but they are also home to a variety of butterflies as they bloom from June to October. These blossoms provide food to butterfly larvae and draw adult butterflies from miles away. It is no wonder why this butterfly bush has become a popular addition to gardens around the world.",
