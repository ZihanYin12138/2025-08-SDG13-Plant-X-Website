  "description": "Honeycrisp apples (Malus 'Honeycrisp') are an amazing fruit for many reasons. Their red and yellow skin is speckled with hues of green and the flesh is sweet, crispy, and juicy. It is said to have one of the best flavor combinations of tartness and sweetness, making it a favorite among apple fans. Its rounded shape and mildly yellow flesh holds more juice than many other apples. Due to its high sugar content and low acidity, Honeycrisp apples are perfect for baking and eating raw. Plus, it also has a longer shelf life, allowing you to enjoy this fruit all season long. Honeycrisp apples truly are amazing.",
