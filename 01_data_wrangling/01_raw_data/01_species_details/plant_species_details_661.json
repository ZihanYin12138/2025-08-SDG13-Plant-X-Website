When it blooms from summer through early autumn, it has tall, slender stalks with small white flowers that cap the top, standing elegantly among all the other aquatic plants. It's amazing for its ability to colonize, helping increase the population and bio-diversity of aquatic environments. Its highly adaptable and will thrive in any water type, from slow moving ponds to streams and rivers. Furthermore, its leaves are edible and have a strong, nutty taste and its seeds are rich in starch and carbohydrates, which make them an important source of food for both people and animals. Northern water plantain is an amazing species that could help support and sustain whole aquatic ecosystems.",
