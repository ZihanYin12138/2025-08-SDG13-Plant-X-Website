  "description": "The Three Flowered Maple (Acer triflorum) is an amazing species of maple tree that boasts unique beauty. It's foliage is a brilliant mix of green, yellow, and orange come fall, and its bark is exfoliated in shades of gray. Its flowers also bring amazement as clustered small flowers in pink appear in early summer. Growing three large yellow-winged fruits in autumn, it's truly a sight to behold. Its foliage stays lush even in areas of extreme cold and heat, making it an ideal choice for the changing environment. A true garden gem, the Three Flowered Maple is an eye-catching delight and an essential addition to any landscape.",
