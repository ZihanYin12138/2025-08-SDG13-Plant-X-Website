  "description": "The Snakebark Maple (Acer davidii) is an amazing tree, beloved by gardeners. It features beautiful gills, which are handsomely striped with tiger-like markings. In the summer, its leaves turn to a bright golden hue and its bark remains smooth, with a distinctive mottled ash-gray coloration. Plant it in a sunny spot to take full advantage of its leaves, which are said to produce a calming effect. It is also low maintenance and very tolerant of the cold, surviving through temperatures as low as -25Â°F. With its stunning shape and amazing color, the Snakebark Maple is a wonderful addition to any landscape!",
