  "description": "Dwarf birch (Betula 'Golden Treasure' CESKY GOLD) is an amazing plant species due to its impressive hardiness. Although it is considered a dwarf, this small shrub can grow up to 6-7 feet tall, making it an ideal choice for small landscaping projects. It is also resistant to pests and disease and can survive in most climates. Its most attractive feature is its bright and vibrant golden-yellow foliage which provides an eye-catching contrast against most garden backgrounds. It is also an ideal choice for providing dense and low-maintenance ground cover throughout the garden and can be relied upon for its year-round interest.",
