  "description": "The Lady Fern (Athyrium filix-femina 'Dre's Dagger') is an amazing plant species due to its longevity and beauty. This fern boasts green, silvery and even hues of purple throughout its broad and lovely fronds. It is a great groundcover and is a breeze to take care of. Lady ferns can also handle different soil types and can stay evergreen even during cold winter temperatures. Lady ferns stay low and wide, spreading horizontally to form an attractive carpet around gardens and landscapes. As an added bonus, they are incredibly low maintenance and have disease and insect resistance. All this, plus their elegant look, make the Lady Fern an excellent and enduring choice for any garden.",
