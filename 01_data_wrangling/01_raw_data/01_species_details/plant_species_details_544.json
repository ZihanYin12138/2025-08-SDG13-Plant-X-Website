  "description": "The Rough Maidenhair Fern is an amazing plant species due to its unique appearance. It is the only species belonging to the Adiantum genus that has a thicker, upright habit. The evergreen plant grows up to three feet high, with a thick clump of stems and light-green fronds providing eye-catching contrast in the garden. It also holds its foliage throughout the winter, allowing for much-needed structure during the season's snow and frost. The slender, lacy fronds are further enhanced by its unique textured veins on their undersides. The Rough Maidenhair Fern is tolerant of a range of soils and temperatures, making it an ideal choice for both gardeners and landscapers.",
