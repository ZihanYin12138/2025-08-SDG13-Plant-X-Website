  "description": "Trifoliate Bittercress (Cardamine trifolia) is an amazing member of the Brassicaceae family. It is a fast-growing plant which reaches a height of 30cm and has trifoliate leaves and a small white flower. It is a valuable source of nectar for bees in the early spring and can often be spotted in damp woodlands and riverbanks. Its remarkable resilience means it has been able to colonize even the most difficult environments and can survive extreme temperatures, drought, and floods. It is also highly edible, with young leaves adding a tangy, peppery flavour to salads. With its remarkable array of characteristics, Trifoliate Bittercress is an amazing addition to any natural environment.",
