  "description": "The hybrid strawberry tree (Arbutus andrachnoides) is one of the most amazing plants you can find. It is a stunning evergreen that can keep its beautiful leaves year-round. It has white and pink-tinged flowers in early spring and dark red edible fruits in late summer. Its fruits are small but loaded with flavors. Its bark is also stunning with its patchy combination of smooth and flaky texture. This tree is also very hardy and can grow in a wide range of climates and terrains, so it's perfect for any garden. Hybrid strawberry trees make a great addition to any landscape, with their amazing looks and delicious fruits.",
