  "description": "The balsam fir (Abies balsamea) is an amazing tree species for many reasons. With thick green needles and a distinctively pyramid shape, this North American evergreen is widely regarded for its beauty. It's also commercially valuable for its fragrant resin, which is the main ingredient of balsam fir oil. In addition, it is widely used as a Christmas tree and for decorating homes. Balsam fir is widely valued for its medicinal properties, which include reducing cold and flu symptoms, as well as aches, pains, and inflammation. Finally, it is a great choice as a fast-growing tree that can be a wonderful addition to any landscape.",
