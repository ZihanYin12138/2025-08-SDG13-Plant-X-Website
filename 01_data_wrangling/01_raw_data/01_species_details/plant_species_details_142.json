  "description": "The Yellow Bird Japanese Maple is one of the most prized maples in the yard. Its bright yellow-green foliage is striking, especially when the tips of each leaf turn golden in the fall. This semi-dwarf maple thrives in partial to full sun and does best in both moist and well-drained soil. Its habit is open and upright and can reach heights of 8â€“10 feet in ten years, making it ideal for small or medium sized gardens. Its vibrant yellow-green foliage glows in the sun and provides a dramatic accent all year. With its graceful weeping habit, it's an excellent choice for adding beautiful interest to shady areas. Whether you select it for its beauty, graceful habit, or year-round color, the Yellow Bird Japanese Maple is a must-have for any garden!",
