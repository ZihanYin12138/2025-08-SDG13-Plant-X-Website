  "description": "The Caucasian fir is amazingly impressive. It is a large evergreen conifer tree native to the Caucasus Mountains, usually reaching a height of 35-45 meters (115-150 feet). It has a tall, straight trunk and a dense, roundish canopy of branches covered in short, sharp needles. The tree is notable for its incredibly tough wood and its outstanding resistance to disease and pests. Native to a range of climates from extremely cold and snowy to mild and temperate, the Caucasian fir is ideally adaptable and hardy. It’s also extremely fast-growing and can reach a mature height within six to seven years. There’s a reason why it’s been used as a Christmas tree for centuries!",
