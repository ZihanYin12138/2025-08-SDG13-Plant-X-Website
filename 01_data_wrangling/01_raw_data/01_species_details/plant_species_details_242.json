It has a vase-like shape and many branches that have an umbrella like appearance. Its leaves are oval shaped, that alternate turning purple in fall and dark green in summer. It produces small, white fragrant flowers that bloom in May and June in the form of a cluster. This species also produces blue-purple, edible fruits that are liked by many species of birds. Its beautiful bark also gives it amazing ornamental value as it sheds from grey to cinnamon in color throughout the year.
