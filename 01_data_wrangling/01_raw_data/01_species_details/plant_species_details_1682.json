  "description": "The American hornbeam (Carpinus caroliniana) is an amazing species of deciduous tree that is commonly found throughout the Eastern United States. It's perfect for any size of garden, as it can reach up to 30 feet tall and has an excellent evergreen foliage. Its bark has a unique flaked texture that stands out in any scenery. It's known for being incredibly durable and tough, making it a great choice for windbreakers and privacy hedges. Its stunning fall foliage of red, orange, and yellow will undoubtedly turn heads, and it's delicate catkins provide an additional late spring delight. The American hornbeam is truly a beautiful addition to any garden.",
