  "description": "Butterfly bush (Buddleja davidii 'Peakeep' PEACOCK) is an amazing plant species because of its vibrant colours and plentiful blooms. The butterfly-like flowers come in shades of blue, purple and white, each with an orange eye and peachy undersides. Not only are the flowers spectacular and a favourite to many butterflies, bees and birds, but the shrub is easy to grow and maintain. This long-blooming shrub tolerates a wide range of soils, as well as heat, humidity and drought. It's strong, fast-growing, and transforms any garden into a pleasant haven for wildlife. Butterfly bush (Buddleja davidii 'Peakeep' PEACOCK) is a truly magnificent addition to any garden.",
