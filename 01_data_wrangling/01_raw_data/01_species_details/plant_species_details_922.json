  "description": "Common bearberry (Arctostaphylos uva-ursi 'Massachusetts') is a low growing evergreen shrub native to North America. It is adored by gardeners for its ability to thrive in acidic and rocky soils, as well as its beautiful, glossy green and red leaves. In addition, it produces white to pink, bell-shaped flowers in the spring and summer, followed by edible red-orange drupes in autumn. This incredible shrub is also extremely easy to care for and grows over time to make a stunning ground cover. The truly amazing feature of common bearberry is that it is both drought- and wet-tolerant, making it ideal for many different garden designs.",
