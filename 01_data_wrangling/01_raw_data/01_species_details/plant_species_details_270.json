  "description": "Gold Rider Leyland Cypress (Cupressocyparis x leylandii 'Gold Rider') is an amazing plant species. An evergreen conifer with a beautiful bright gold new growth, contrasting dark-green mature foliage and sharply contrasting gold tips on the branch ends. It has an upright, bushy habit and can reach heights of up to 40 feet with a 3-foot spread - making it ideal for hedges, windbreaks, and screens. Plus, it is very tolerant of various soil types, thrives in climates with hot summers, and is also very wind and drought tolerant. Gold Rider Leyland Cypress is also unmatched in versatility as it can be grown in containers as well as directly in the ground. An easy-care, but stunning addition to any garden.",
