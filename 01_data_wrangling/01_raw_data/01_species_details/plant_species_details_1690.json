  "description": "Hickory (Carya laneyi) is an amazing plant species. Its leaves are large and bright green, the height of which can reach above 50 feet. The bark of the hickory is thick and deeply furrowed and it produces small green flowers, followed by nuts, which are a favorite of wildlife such as squirrels and chipmunks. The nuts are also popular with people and can be used in various recipes. Hickory wood is very strong and is great for making furniture, tool handles, and flooring. Using hickory puts you in touch with nature, transforming any space into a place of great beauty.",
