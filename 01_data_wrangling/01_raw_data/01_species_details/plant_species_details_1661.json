  "description": "Sedge (Carex Pensylvanica) is an amazing plant species that is often overlooked. This clumping, ornamental grass, grows in moist conditions and is known for its attractive, light green foliage. It is also tolerant of a wide range of soils, including heavy clay and shallow soils. Furthermore, it will naturally fill in gaps with its spreading habit to provide a uniform look and transition between alongside taller grasses. Another added bonus is its deer resistance. Its flowers, if present, will add a pleasant, subtle color contrast. This low-maintenance beauty is an excellent choice for naturalizing lawns, stream and wetland areas, and woodlands.",
