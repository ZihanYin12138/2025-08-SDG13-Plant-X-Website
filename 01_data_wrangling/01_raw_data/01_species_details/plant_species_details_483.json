  "description": "Yarrow (Achillea millefolium 'Montrose Rose') is an amazing plant species for many reasons. It is an excellent choice for native landscapes because of its Deer and drought resistance. It is also very attractive and has a long blooming season of mid-spring to late summer. Its clusters of fragrant, attractive pale rose-pink flowers add great texture and color to the garden. Its fern-like foliage and clump-forming habits make it very versatile in the garden. It can be used as a back-of-the-border plant or a container plant, as well as an edging plant or for mass plantings. It also makes for great cut flowers for floral arrangements. Yarrow is an easy to care for plant that is sure to add beauty to any garden.",
