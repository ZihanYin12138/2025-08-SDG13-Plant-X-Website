  "description": "Bugleweed (Ajuga reptans 'Purple Torch') boasts variegated purple foliage with dark vegetable-based colors. This low-growing, mat-forming perennial is a great choice for as a ground cover or for edging. It blooms in late spring or early summer, producing tiny, dense, blue-violet spikes. It thrives in moist, well-drained locations with full or partial sunlight, and is ideal for those difficult areas where other plants may find it hard to survive. The incredibly versatile bugleweed is heat and cold tolerant and can also act as a natural weed suppressant. It's a great option for homeowners who are looking for low maintenance and beautiful perennials.",
