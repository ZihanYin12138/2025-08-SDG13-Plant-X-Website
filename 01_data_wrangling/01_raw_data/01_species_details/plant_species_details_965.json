  "description": "Low Scape Mound is an amazing black chokeberry variety due to its low-growing, mounding form and excellent disease resistance. This perennial shrub produces glossy, dark-green foliage that is followed by fragrant white flowers in late spring. The fruit that appears in early summer is edible, and can be used to make delicious jams, jellies and juices. The dark-purple, low-growing growth habit of this black chokeberry is ideal for landscapes that don't have time for trimming and pruning, since it requires only minimal maintenance. It is also extremely hardy and is resistant to most diseases. With its beautiful foliage, vibrant flowers and tasty fruits, Low Scape Mound is an attractive and productive addition to any garden.",
