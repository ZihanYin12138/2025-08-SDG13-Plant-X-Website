  "description": "The Lady Fern (Athyrium filix-femina 'Victoriae') is a hardy and graceful plant with an amazing variety of form and texture. Its lacy fronds come in a range of sizes, depending on the variety. It is a fast-growing deciduous fern that can reach up to three feet tall and wide, boasting a glossy green foliage in its youth and changing to a handsome bronze in its mature state. Its fronds are extremely long-lasting, withstanding even the toughest climates. It's evergreen throughout the year, further improving its appearance and adding interest to the landscape. The Lady Fern is an excellent addition to any garden, as it is both low maintenance and exceptionally striking.",
