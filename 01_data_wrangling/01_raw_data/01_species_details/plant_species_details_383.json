  "description": "The Spartan Apple is a stunning and hardy tree, making it a great choice for any garden. Its fragrant white blossom opens to deep red fruit that are packed full of flavour. It is resistant to many common apple diseases and its branches are well-suited to training and pruning. Spartans are not only beautiful but highly productive trees that yield a bumper crop. Aside from its fruit, the Spartan is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its naturally arching branches. It is especially well-suited to small gardens, presenting an attractive shape even when not in full bloom. Plant a Spartan Apple for a stunning and fruitful addition to your garden!",
