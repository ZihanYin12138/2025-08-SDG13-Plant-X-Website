  "description": "White Sage (Artemisia ludoviciana) is a natively North American herb which has been used for centuries for its remarkable healing properties. Its powerful antimicrobial and antiviral effects make it a go-to as a healing remedy across many cultures. It's also known for its sweet, relaxing aroma, which makes it great for diffusing and aromatherapy. Many experts also swear by it for purifying and cleansing, both physically and spiritually. Moreover, it's drought and heat tolerant, making it ideal for growing in dry climates. As a result, it's an amazingly resilient and powerful plant that offers so much to its environment and people.",
