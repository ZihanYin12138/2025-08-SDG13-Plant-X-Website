  "description": "Bush's poppy mallow (Callirhoe bushii) is an amazing flower species native to California. It is an upright perennial that has vibrant purple cup-shaped flowers. During the warm months, it is a blaze of colour throughout dry prairie grasslands and open woodlands. It's scientific name, Callirhoe, derives from the Greek words 'Calli' and 'h≈çe', meaning beautiful face. This is due to its poppy-like blooms that are supported by long branching stems. It's a great flower for those who want to make a statement in their garden, as it doesn't require a lot of maintenance and is very attractive to butterflies and other pollinators.",
