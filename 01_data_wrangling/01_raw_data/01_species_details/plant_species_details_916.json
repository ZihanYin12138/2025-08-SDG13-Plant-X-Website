  "description": "The New Caledonian pine, also known as Araucaria columnaris, is an incredibly unique plant species. It has a unique, towering columnar form and produces pine cones that are almost entirely exposed. This gives it an amazing and unmistakable look. It also has a high drought and winter cold tolerance, allowing it to thrive in harsh climates. New Caledonian pines also have a fast growth rate, making them a popular choice for landscaping projects. Rich in history, these pines are also known as \"Nut Pines\" in reference to their edible nuts, which have been part of the local culture for centuries. A truly stunning species, the New Caledonian pine is a great choice for anyone looking for an interesting, durable and resilient ornamental tree.",
