  "description": "Swamp milkweed (Asclepias incarnata) is a truly amazing plant species. From its bright pink and white flowers, to its deep green and purple leaves, its visual appearance is stunning. It is also an incredible habitat for butterflies and other insects. Swamp milkweed's long stems are home to caterpillars of monarch and other butterflies, and its abundant nectar provides sustenance for Hummingbirds, bees and other nectar-loving insects. It's fragrant, edible root, when boiled, has many culinary uses, and its natural latex has many medicinal benefits. Its deep root system releases oxygen and nitrogen into the soil, providing oxygen to nearby plants and moisture to shallow wetlands. This incredible species will provide beauty and benefit to any ecosystem!",
