  "description": "The Swan River Daisy is an amazing flowering plant indigenous to Australia. Its showy, daisy-like flowers grow in gorgeous colors such as purple, pink, white, and yellow. Its thin, upright stems give the daisy an elegant and graceful appearance, making it a perfect choice for any garden. Its tolerance of both dry and wet conditions and its ability to tolerate different temperatures make it easy to grow and maintain in any climate. It's also low-maintenance and can withstand a variety of neglect. Its unique flowerhead, which varies from one-half to two inches wide, stands out against its robust, deep green leaves. The Swan River Daisy is a great addition to any flowerbed and will bring color and beauty to any outdoor setting.",
