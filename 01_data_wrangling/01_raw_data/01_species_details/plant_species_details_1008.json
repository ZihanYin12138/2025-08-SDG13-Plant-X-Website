  "description": "Prairie milkweed (Asclepias hirtella) is an incredible plant species native to the North American prairies. It is drought-tolerant and fast-growing, with glossy leaves and pinnate clusters of bright star-shaped flowers. With its long taproots and deep stems it is able to access water and nutrients which helps it thrive in drier areas. This species also plays a critical role in the food chain by providing food for a variety of pollinators, including monarch butterflies. Its strong scent helps attract beneficial insects, such as predatory wasps, which help keep pest populations in check. Prairie milkweed makes a beautiful addition to any garden and is sure to bring lots of beauty and ecological value to its environment.",
