          "description": "Branch canker and dieback Formerly known as Dothiorella Canker, caused by the fungi Botryosphaeria spp. and Phomopsis, is a plant disease that affects woody hosts like avocado trees. It forms cankers on limbs and trunks, leading to symptoms such as reddish sap exudation, cracked and discolored bark, and cankers that penetrate the xylem. Additionally, it can cause shoot blight, leaf scorch, and stem end rot on fruit. "

          "subtitle": "How do Branch canker and dieback (Botryosphaeria spp.) occur?",
          "description": "Branch canker and dieback are reproduced through spores produced by fungi. These spores enter plants through pruning wounds. Spread occurs through the air dispersal of spores and rain or irrigation splash. Pycnidia, spore-forming structures, on dead wood can also contribute to disease transmission. Pruning activities and environmental factors, such as heavy rainfall and stress, can increase dissemination and infection. "
