          "description": "Microdochium patch, also known as pink snow mold or Fusarium patch, is a fungal disease caused by Microdochium nivale. It commonly occurs in regions with extended periods of wet, cool weather and affects cool season turfgrasses such as bentgrass, Kentucky bluegrass, ryegrasses, and more. Symptoms include small, circular dead spots with a pinkish color. In the early morning, affected areas may show white to pink mycelia. Under snow cover or in wet conditions, visible white fungal growth may be present."

        {
          "subtitle": "How does Fusarium patch, pink snow mold (Microdochium nivale) occur?",
          "description": "Microdochium patch reproduces through spore dispersal. The fungal spores are found in infected plant debris or soil. When the weather is wet and cool, the spores germinate and infect the turfgrass. The fungus grows and spreads through fungal threads called mycelium within the turfgrass. In snowy or wet conditions, the fungus produces white to pink spore masses (sporodochia). These spore masses help the fungus spread and infect other susceptible turfgrass plants, completing its reproductive cycle."
