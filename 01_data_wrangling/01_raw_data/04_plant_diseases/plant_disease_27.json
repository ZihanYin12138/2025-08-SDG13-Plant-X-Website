          "description": "Ganoderma lucidum, also known as varnish fungus or reishi mushroom, is a wood-rotting fungus that affects trees globally. It causes Ganoderma rot, a severe and often fatal tree disease. Susceptible species include maples, oaks, honeylocusts, ashes, elms, and conifers. The fungus attacks tree roots and lower trunks, leading to decay and structural weakness. Symptoms include yellowing, wilting, undersized leaves, dead branches, and the formation of shelf-like fruiting bodies (conks) on the lower trunk and exposed roots. "

        {
          "subtitle": "How does Varnish fungus rot (Ganoderma lucidum) occur?",
          "description": "During humid summers, new spores are released from conks, which are reproductive structures. These spores infect open wounds on the root flares and lower trunk of susceptible trees. Once germinated, the spores cause infection, attacking the sapwood of major roots and the lower trunk. As time passes, the decayed wood increases, resulting in soft and spongy wood in critical tree areas. The conks, produced yearly, appear in summer and fall, eventually decaying and deteriorating."

However, systemic fungicides like propiconazole and thiabendazole are commonly used for managing other tree diseases.\n\n•\tProfessionals may suggest specific treatments, such as fungicides or other disease management techniques.\n\n•\tIn cases of advanced decay or compromised structural integrity, professional intervention may involve the safe removal of infected trees to prevent accidents and further spread of the fungus.\n"
