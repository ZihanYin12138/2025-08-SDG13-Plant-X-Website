          "description": "Ascochyta gerberae is a fungal pathogen that causes leaf spot diseases in ornamental plants and gerbera daisies. It is widespread across many regions. The disease presents symptoms as small, irregularly shaped spots with grey to brown centers and yellow borders. These spots can rapidly expand, forming large brown lesions with concentric markings. The affected leaves may eventually wither and die."

        {
          "subtitle": "How does leaf spot disease ( Ascochyta gerbera) occur?",
          "description": "Ascochyta gerberae reproduces through spores, which can be spread by wind, water, or infected plant material. The spores enter plants through openings or wounds. The fungus can survive in plant debris and soil, infecting new plants with its spores. Under certain conditions, sexual reproduction occurs, leading to the development of new strains with varying levels of virulence and resistance traits."

          "subtitle": "Application of Fungicides",
