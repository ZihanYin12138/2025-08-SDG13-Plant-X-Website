          "description": "Powdery mildew is a fungal disease that commonly affects roses. Sphaerotheca pannosa var. rosae is one of the fungal species responsible for powdery mildew on roses. It is found worldwide in temperate and warm climates. Infected plants display a white or grayish powdery growth on leaves, stems, and buds. Leaves may turn yellow or brown, become wrinkled, and eventually wither. Additionally, it can distort the appearance of flowers and hinder the growth of new rose buds."

        {
          "subtitle": "How does Powdery mildew (Sphaerotheca pannosa)occur",
          "description": "Powdery mildew begins with fungal spores in favorable conditions. It spreads through airborne spores or contact with infected plants. It prefers moderate temperatures, high humidity, and limited air circulation. Spores landing on susceptible plants germinate, forming a white or grayish powdery growth on leaves, stems, and buds. The cycle repeats as spores are released, infecting other plants and perpetuating the disease."

          "subtitle": "Watering Techniques and Good Sanitation",
          "description": "Avoid overhead watering, as wet foliage can create favorable conditions for powdery mildew. Instead, water at the base of the plants early in the day to allow leaves to dry. Practice sanitation by removing and disposing of infected plant debris to prevent fungus overwintering."
