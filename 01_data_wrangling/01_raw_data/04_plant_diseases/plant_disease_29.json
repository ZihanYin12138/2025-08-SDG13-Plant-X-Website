          "description": "Powdery mildew (Podosphaera tridactyla) is a fungal disease that affects various plants worldwide. Commonly affected plants include plums, peaches grapes, cucumbers, roses, and others. It manifests as white or gray powdery growth on leaves, stems, flowers, and fruits. Common symptoms include circular patches of white fungal growth on fruit in spring, which later become scabby and dry. It occurs worldwide and can be found in various regions and climates. "

          "description": "Erysiphe cichoracearum survives winter as spore-forming structures called cleistothecia on shoots, leaves, and bark. In spring, spores are released and spread by wind, water, or insects. They infect susceptible plants like plum trees, forming a white, powdery coating. The fungus grows, reproduces, and spreads the infection to other plants. It can also overwinter on plant debris or dormant buds."

It is important to follow label instructions, including any restrictions on specific crops.\n"
