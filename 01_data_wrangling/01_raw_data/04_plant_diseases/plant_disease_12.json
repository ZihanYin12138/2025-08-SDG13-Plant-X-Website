          "description": "Crown gall is a plant disease caused by the soil-inhibiting bacterium Agrobacterium tumefaciens. It is distributed worldwide and affects a wide range of plants, including fruit trees (e.g., apple, pear), nut trees (e.g., almond, walnut), ornamental plants (e.g., roses, chrysanthemums), vines (e.g., grapevines), and field crops (e.g., cotton, tomatoes). The disease is identified by the presence of galls, and overgrowths, on roots and at the base of woody plants. These galls can also appear on stems and leaves. Crown gall can lead to stunted growth, reduced yield, and weakened plants."

        {
          "subtitle": "How does crown gall (Agrobacterium tumefaciens) occur? ",
          "description": "Crown gall occurs when plants become infected with Agrobacterium tumefaciens. The bacterium enters the plant through wounds or natural openings and transfers its DNA, known as T-DNA, into the plant cells. \nThis DNA becomes integrated into the plant's genetic material, causing the cells to divide uncontrollably and resulting in the formation of galls. The infection can spread within the plant and to other plants through various means such as soil, water, or infected plant parts.\n"
