          "description": "Pseudomonas syringae is a bacterial pathogen that causes economically important diseases in the Pacific Northwest. It infects a wide range of fruits, vegetables, and ornamental plants, including plums, cherries, apricots, peaches, and ornamental Prunus species. Common symptoms include flower blast, dead buds, necrotic leaf spots, fruit spots, shoot-tip dieback, stem cankers, and inhibited seed germination. Disease severity varies, with factors like wounds, plant dormancy, soil conditions, and dual infections increasing susceptibility. "

        {
          "subtitle": "How dose Bacterial canker (Pseudomonas syringae) occur?",
          "description": "Pseudomonas syringae reproduces through binary fission, dividing into two identical daughter cells. It rapidly multiplies in favorable conditions of high humidity and moderate temperatures. The bacterium can survive in infected plant debris, weeds, and soil. Spread occurs through water splashes, wind, insects, and contaminated tools. It can also establish latent infections within plant tissues, aiding its long-term persistence and further spread."
