          "subtitle": "What is Powdery mildew (Erysiphe graminis)?",
          "description": "Powdery mildew is a fungal disease that affects a wide range of plants, including ornamentals, vegetables, and turfgrass. It is distributed worldwide and thrives in conditions with high humidity and moderate temperatures. Infected plants exhibit grayish white, powdery growth on leaf surfaces, starting as isolated patches and spreading over larger areas. In advanced stages, affected leaves may turn yellow and become distorted. "

        {
          "subtitle": "How does Powdery mildew (Erysiphe graminis) occur?",
          "description": "Powdery mildew reproduces through sexual reproduction, forming fruiting bodies called cleistothecia that release spores. These spores can be carried by wind or other means to infect susceptible plants. Additionally, it reproduces asexually by producing conidia, which are airborne spores formed on the powdery growth of infected plants. These conidia can spread to new hosts, initiating new infections, and facilitating the rapid dissemination of the disease."

Azoxystrobin, propiconazole (BumperÂ® 250 EC), tebuconazole, myclobutanil (Orius 250 EW), fenarimol, difenoconazole, cyprodinil, and flutriafol are examples of synthetic fungicides effective against this fungus.\n\n Sulfur-based fungicides and Biofungicides based on Bacillus subtilis can also be used against this. Adhere to the instructions and apply them as directed."
