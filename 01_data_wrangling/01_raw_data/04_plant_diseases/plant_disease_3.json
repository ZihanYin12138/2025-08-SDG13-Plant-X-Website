          "description": "Pythium blight is a fungal disease that impacts turfgrass, causing small circular spots that combine to form withered, reddish-brown, greasy-looking leaves, earning it the name \"grease spot.\" This disease thrives in warm, humid conditions, especially when humidity is high and temperatures exceed 86°F. It affects all grass species, leading to seedling damping-off and root rots. Pythium blight spreads rapidly, capable of killing extensive grass areas within just 24 hours."

        {
          "subtitle": "How does Pythium Blight occur?",
          "description": "Pythium blight reproduces through both asexual and sexual methods. In humid conditions, it releases zoospores that can swim in water and infect nearby turfgrass. It also produces durable sexual spores that help it survive in soil and plant debris. These reproductive strategies allow Pythium blight to spread and persist, causing damage to susceptible plants in turfgrass environments."
