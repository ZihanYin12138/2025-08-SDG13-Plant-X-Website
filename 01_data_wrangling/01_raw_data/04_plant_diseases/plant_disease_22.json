          "description": "Apple scab is a fungal disease caused by Venturia inaequalis. It affects apple trees in cool and moist regions during spring and summer. This disease poses a substantial economic threat to apple growers due to potential crop losses. It appears as dark blotches or lesions on leaves, fruit, and occasionally young twigs. Infected young leaves can cause deformities, and affected trees may experience premature fruit drops."

        {
          "subtitle": "How does Apple Scab (Venturia inaequalis) occur?",
          "description": "Apple scab is caused by the fungus Venturia inaequalis. It reproduces through spores that are produced by the fungus and overwinter on fallen diseased leaves. In spring, the fungus releases spores into the air, which are carried by wind to new leaves, flowers, fruit, or twigs. Moisture on the plant surface is necessary for the spores to cause new infections. These infections develop into visible spots and produce more spores within 9 to 17 days. The spores are then spread by wind, rain, or irrigation, continuing the cycle of infection."
