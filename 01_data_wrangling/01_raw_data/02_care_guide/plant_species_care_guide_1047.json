          "description": "Aster (Aster frikartii 'Jungfrau') should be watered weekly, allowing the soil to dry out slightly between waterings. When watering, water thoroughly and give enough water to reach the base of the roots. During the summer, water deeply every week, and during the winter every 2 to 3 weeks. However, this will vary depending on the temperature and humidity levels in your area. If the soil feels dry to the touch, give the plant a little water."

          "description": "Aster (Aster frikartii 'Jungfrau') should be grown in a location that receives at least 6 hours of full sun exposure each day. Varieties that grow in partial shade can tolerate slightly less sunlight, but to produce the most vibrant blossoms, they should be exposed to full sun all day. It is also important for this plant species to receive enough sunlight to properly grow and thrive, and to avoid potential diseases or other growth issues. Generally speaking, providing ample sunlight during the day (at least 6 hours) is more important for Aster, rather than the time of day it receives sunlight."

          "description": "Aster Frikartii 'Jungfrau' should be pruned annually in late winter or early spring. Pruning helps to maintain its shape and remove any dead or diseased branches. Start by removing all dead flower heads back to a point above a healthy bud. This will encourage more flowers for the following year. To shape the shrub, thin out congested or overgrown branches or shoots and cut back the entire shrub by 1/3, preferably to just above a healthy bud. This helps to create an attractive, more open shape, as well as encouraging better flowering for the next season."
