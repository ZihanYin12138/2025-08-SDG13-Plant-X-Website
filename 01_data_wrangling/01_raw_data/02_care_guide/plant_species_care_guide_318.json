          "description": "Watering for bay laurel should be done every other week and should be deep, but not overly wet. During each watering, it is best to give the plant between 1 and 2 inches of water, depending on the size of the plant. If the plant is completely dry to the touch and showing signs of wilting, then it is time to water. During the summer and hotter months, watering may be needed more frequently, while in the winter and cooler months, watering can possibly be reduced."

          "description": "Bay Laurels prefer full to partial sun and will grow best in locations that provide at least 6 hours of sunlight per day. It is best to plant them in an area that gets some shade during hot summer afternoons, as too much direct sunlight can scorch their leaves. Bay Laurels are evergreen, so they will need a good amount of sun throughout most of the year in order to thrive. In colder climates, they should be planted in areas that get at least 4-6 hours of direct sunlight each day."

          "description": "Bay Laurel can generally be pruned throughout the growing season, from late spring through autumn. Late spring and early summer are the best times for major pruning. However, light pruning can be done throughout the growing season as necessary. Prune off any dead, damaged, or diseased limbs and any crossing limbs. You can also prune any limbs that are too close together or competing for the same space. Pruning should be done with sharp clean shears and always make sure to cut just above a bud or node. Depending on the size and shape of the plant, you can prune lightly throughout the summer to maintain its form. After the main pruning season, you can do a light shaping as needed in autumn."
