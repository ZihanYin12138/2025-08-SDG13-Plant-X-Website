During the cooler months of spring and fall, watering every 5-7 days is usually sufficient. Make sure not to water too much or too often, as water logged roots can cause root rot and other issues."

The ideal time for it to get the most sun is during the morning and through the afternoon. While this species of maple can tolerate periods of dappled shade, full sun is recommended to support healthy growth, good foliage colour and abundant flowering. "

          "description": "Red Rhapsody Amur Maple should be pruned annually in late winter or very early spring, before active and new growth begins. Pruning should be light, removing only dead and damaged branches and any crossing branches. If major pruning is required, it is best to do this over a few seasons. Heavy pruning is not recommended for this species."
