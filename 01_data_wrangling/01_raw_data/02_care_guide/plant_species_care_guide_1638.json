          "description": "Frank's sedge should be watered once or twice a week, taking care not to over-water. A good rule of thumb is to wait until the soil is dry to a depth of 1 inch, then water until the soil is saturated. Allow the soil to dry out again before watering again. In the warmest months, such as summer, the plant may require more frequent waterings. When watering, make sure to avoid wetting the foliage as this can lead to disease issues."

          "description": "Frank's sedge (Carex frankii) generally prefers bright but indirect sunlight or partial shade. The amount of sunlight required depends on the season and climate that the plant is being grown in. In summer months, Frank's sedge should receive up to 4 hours of direct sunlight per day. During the winter months, when the days are shorter, it should be kept in a location that receives less sunlight. It is important to protect the plant from direct sunlight, as it can cause leaf scorch. It prefers to receive morning sunlight and should be shielded from afternoon sunlight, if possible."

          "description": "Frank's sedge should be pruned in the winter when the plant is dormant. Pruning should be done to remove dead leaves and stems, and to shape the plant. Pruning should be light and done in moderation, avoiding drastic shearing. In general, it is best to remove no more than 1-third of the foliage at any 1 time. Trimming the plant can also help it to retain a more natural, bushy shape."
