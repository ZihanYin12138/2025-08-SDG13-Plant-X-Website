          "description": "Ohio buckeye trees prefer soil that is evenly moist but not soggy. During the growing season, between May and September, they need to be watered deeply and regularly. One to 2 inches (2.5-5 cm) of precipitation per week is optimal. If you don't get this amount of water naturally from the rain, you should supplement by watering with a garden hose or watering can. During the winter, or when the plant is dormant, water every 3-4 weeks. During extreme droughts, water only when the leaves begin to wilt. Itâ€™s better to water deeply and less frequently so the Ohio buckeye tree can develop a strong root system."

          "description": "Ohio buckeye (Aesculus glabra 'Nana') plants require medium to bright indirect sunlight for optimum health and growth. The best location for these plants is one that receives at least 4 to 5 hours of sunlight a day, preferably during morning and early afternoon hours. This species of buckeye should be protected from hot afternoon sun as it can cause leaf burn. If necessary, you can lightly filter the sun by using a sheer curtain to prevent the leaves from getting scorched or burnt."

          "description": "For Ohio buckeye, pruning should take place in late winter or early spring, before the new growth appears. Prune out any dead or diseased branches, and thin out any excessively dense growth. Once the tree is established, prune off broken or damaged branches, and remove any crossing or rubbing branches. It is best to prune off no more than 1/3 of the crown at any time. When pruning, always be mindful to maintain the natural form of the tree and avoid pruning it into an artificial shape."
