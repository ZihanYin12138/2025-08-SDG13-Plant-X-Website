          "description": "Giant hyssop (Agastache 'Summer Love') should be watered deeply every 7 to 10 days during the growing season. In the spring and summer, this means that water should be applied until the soil is completely saturated each time. During hot weather it may be necessary to water once per week or even more often. During the cooler fall and winter months, water the giant hyssop only once every 2 to 4 weeks, allowing the soil to dry out in between. Monitor the moisture levels as you water to ensure that the soil remains saturated but not waterlogged."

          "description": "Giant Hyssop (Agastache 'Summer Love') is considered a sun-loving plant, so it should receive at least 8 hours of direct sunlight every day for optimal health and growth. This plant prefers full sun, so the majority of its light exposure should be during the day's sunniest hours. Depending on your geographic region, the sunniest hours may vary, but typically this will be from mid-morning to mid-afternoon. In the summer when the days are longer, giant hyssop can typically tolerate up to 12 hours of direct sunlight a day without any harm. "

The pruning should focus on removing old, weak and diseased branches, and any dead or woody stems. This will help to promote new growth and encourage the plant to become more bushy. "
