Reduce watering frequency in the Fall as temperatures begin to cool. Do not saturate the soil, as the roots are shallow and can rot easily if the soil remains soaked."

It should receive about 6-8 hours of sunshine each day, with some afternoon shade to protect it from the highest-intensity summer sun. In some regions, such as warmer climates, Osakazuki Japanese Maple may need to be protected from the afternoon sun with partial shade, particularly in the hottest months (typically from late June to late September)."

          "description": "Osakazuki Japanese Maple should be pruned in late winter or early spring. Pruning should be relatively minimal, removing any dead or diseased wood and selectively removing branches to maintain a desired shape. Avoid pruning more than 1-third of the treeâ€™s living branches in a single season, as shock could cause serious damage."
