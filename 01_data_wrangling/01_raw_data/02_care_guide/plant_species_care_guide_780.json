          "description": "Blue Star (Amsonia hubrichtii) should be watered about once every 7-14 days, depending on the season. In the spring and summer months, the soil should be kept moist. During hot, dry spells, it may need to be watered more frequently. In the fall and winter, your plant should be watered less often, only when the soil is dry to the touch. In any season, make sure to water deeply and evenly each time, and avoid watering too often, as this can lead to root rot."

Depending on the region, it will prefer direct sun in the early morning and afternoon, and partial shade in the hottest part of the day. When grown in full sun, it will need additional irrigation during periods of hot and dry weather."

          "description": "The best time to prune a blue star shrub is late winter, before new growth emerges. Prune off dead and diseased branches while they are still dormant. Additionally, prune any stray branches that are growing outside of the shrub's desired shape. Moderate to heavy pruning is recommended for blue star, as it helps to maintain its perimeter and encourage new shoots of growth.\n\nAlso, in early spring, remove any flowers that have finished blooming and shear back any new growth that is overcrowding the shrub. Prune in a way that encourages an airy, open structure with good airflow. Be sure to not prune more than 1/3 of the plant as it can shock the shrub and damage it."
