          "description": "Beautyberry plants should be watered regularly, at least once a week. Water slowly, making sure to give the soil a thorough soaking. The soil should be kept moist but not soggy. If the top inch of soil feels dry to the touch, it's time to water. During the hottest times of summer, however, beautyberry plants may need to be watered more often, every 3-4 days, depending on the temperature, humidity and soil type. Avoid overwatering, as soggy soil can cause the plant's roots to rot."

          "description": "Beautyberry (Callicarpa dichotoma f. albifructa) grows best in full sun, meaning 6-8 hours of direct sunlight per day. This exposure will help the plant produce more of its beautiful white and pink fruit. However, it is important to note that when exposed to direct sunlight for too long the foliage may become scorched. It is best to provide the beautyberry with morning sunlight followed by partial afternoon shade. This will help prevent foliage damage while still allowing the plant to receive the beneficial light it needs."

          "description": "Beautyberry (Callicarpa dichotoma f. albifructa) should be pruned twice a year for optimal growth and shape: once in late winter before new growth begins, and again in mid-summer after flowering is finished. \n\nIn late winter, remove any weak, damaged, or dead branches and stem crossings. Then thin out the branches to create a uniform shape. Cut the branches back to the desired shape and thin out any dense areas. \n\nIn mid-summer, cut back about 1-third of the branches. This will promote new growth and keep the plant dense. It is also important to cut back any branches that are outgrowing their intended size or shape.\n\nOverall, pruning beautyberry is a relatively minimal process and only requires about an hour or so of maintenance each season in order to keep the plant looking healthy and vibrant."
