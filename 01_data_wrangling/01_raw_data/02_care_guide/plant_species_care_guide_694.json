          "description": "The prairie onion (Allium stellatum) is a drought tolerant plant and therefore generally does not require a lot of water to grow and thrive. Water the plant when the soil is dry to the touch. Deep water once every 3 to 4 weeks during the growing season, stopping when the plant's foliage turns yellow and begins to die back. You can also provide it with light, frequent drizzles of water during extremely hot weather. Avoid overhead watering or watering too often as this can cause fungal diseases and root rot."

          "description": "Prairie onion (Allium stellatum) prefers full sun, which means it needs at least 6 hours of direct sunlight each day. Despite its preference of full sun, prairie onion tolerates partial shade, which can supplemented with up to 4 hours of sun each day. It is best to avoid deep shade as this will reduce flower and bulb production. "

          "description": "Prairie onion (Allium stellatum) should be pruned in late winter to early spring. Cut the flower stalks down to the base of the plant, as the flowers fade, but do not cut back the foliage. If the foliage is overcrowded, prune back about a 1/3 of the clump. This will stimulate fresh new growth. Pruning will also keep the clump from becoming too large, or taking over other nearby plants."
