          "description": "Arizona beggarstick (Bidens aurea) should be watered once a month during the growing season, which falls between March and October. During the spring and summer months, the plant should be watered generously, providing a thorough soaking to the soil. In the fall, watering can be lessened and in the winter months, it can be reduced to just enough to keep the soil slightly damp. Make sure that the plant is in well-draining soil to reduce the likelihood of root rot. The plant is relatively drought-tolerant, but adequate moisture will ensure that it thrives and produces flowers."

          "description": "Sunlight is essential for the Arizona beggarstick (Bidens aurea) to thrive, as it requires at least 6 hours of direct sunlight each day. Ideally, the plant should be planted in full sun, but may tolerate some afternoon shade if necessary. Additionally, the plant benefits from supplemental light if it is exposed to less than the ideal 6 hours of sunlight. When in full sun, the Arizona beggarstick should be watered regularly to keep the soil lightly moist and should be fertilized every 12 weeks in order to support healthy growth."

          "description": "Arizona beggarstick (Bidens aurea) is a vigorous, heat-tolerant annual that grows to between 12-24 inches tall and 16 inches wide. It should be pruned regularly to control its size and shape and to promote healthy, compact growth. Pruning should be done when the plant is actively growing (usually from early spring through mid-summer). For most plants, pruning should be done to remove any dead, diseased, or damaged stems and branches. Pruning can also be used to reduce the overall size of the plant, and to encourage new, fresh growth. It is recommended to prune no more than 1/3 of the overall plant at any 1 time. Doing so can help to maintain the health of the plant and prevent it from becoming too lanky and unruly."
