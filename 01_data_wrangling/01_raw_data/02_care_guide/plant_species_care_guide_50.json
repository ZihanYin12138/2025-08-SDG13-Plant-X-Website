          "description": "Chitose Yama Japanese Maple should be watered regularly. Water the plant about 2 or 3 times a week, allowing the soil to dry out slightly between waterings. The plant thrives best in a moist soil that is never dried out or saturated. Avoid overwatering, as it can cause the leaves to droop and rot to occur in the roots. Ensure the soil is well drained to keep excess water from accumulating in the root zone. During hot weather, make sure to water the plant more often. If you’re not sure when to water, a good rule of thumb is to check the soil about 2 inches deep to see if the soil is dry. If it is, it’s time to water."

          "description": "Chitose Yama Japanese Maple does best when exposed to direct sunlight for at least 3-4 hours per day. It prefers morning sun and afternoon shade, preferably partial shade, which helps to protect its delicate foliage from the afternoon heat and ensure proper growth. During periods of especially hot weather, it may be beneficial to provide additional shade or move the plant to a more shaded area."

          "description": "Chitose Yama Japanese Maple should be pruned between late winter and early spring, just before it breaks dormancy. Pruning should be minimal, with no more than 1-third of the branches cut back each year. Remove any dead, diseased, or damaged branches and thin the canopy to improve air circulation and light penetration. This should allow for more vigorous and dense foliage growth. Prune the shrub into its natural shape, avoiding cuts that leave large pruning wounds or produce excessive dieback."
