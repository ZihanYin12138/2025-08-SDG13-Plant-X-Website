Water when the soil feels dry about 1 inch (2.54 cm) below the surface. Avoid watering during the hotter hours of the day to help reduce the chances of mildew and rot. During summer months, provide garlic with 1 to 1.5 inches (2.54-3.81 cm) of water per week. In the cooler months, reduce watering to every 10-14 days."
