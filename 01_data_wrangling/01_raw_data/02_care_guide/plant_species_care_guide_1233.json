          "description": "Oregon grape-holly should be watered deeply every 7-10 days throughout the growing season. During the summer months, the soil should never be allowed to dry out completely and soil moisture should be checked regularly. In hotter climates, more frequent watering may be needed in order to keep the soil consistently moist. It is important to note that too much water can also be damaging and can cause root rot. Therefore, a heavy layer of mulch should be applied to the soil to help retain moisture and prevent weeds. During the winter months, the plant should only be watered every 4-6 weeks."

          "description": "Oregon grape-holly (Berberis aquifolium 'Orange Flame') prefers full sun and does best when receiving 6 hours or more of direct sunlight each day. However, the plant can also tolerate partial shade and can even tolerate some shade when it's exposed to the sun's rays for the bulk of its allotted daily amount. In order to promote blooms and berries, Oregon grape-holly should receive sun for most of the day. If planted in shade, the plant may flower, but there is a chance that there may be fewer blooms and no berries if the plant is not receiving enough sun."

          "description": "Oregon grape-holly (Berberis aquifolium 'Orange Flame') benefits from regular pruning in order to maintain its shape, health, and vigor. Pruning should be done in mid-spring before the plant breaks dormancy. Pruning should be kept to a minimum with only light removal of any dead or damaged branches and old wood. The main shoots should not be cut back, as this will reduce flowering and fruiting. Instead remove spindly, weak, and crossing branches. Pruning unwanted branches helps to promote strong new growth."
