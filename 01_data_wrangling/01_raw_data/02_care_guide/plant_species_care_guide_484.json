During the hot summer months, water deeply to moisten the soil around the roots of the plant. Make sure to water the yarrow until you see moisture coming out of the drainage hole in the bottom of the pot. During the cooler winter months, reduce watering significantly and allow the soil to dry out slightly between waterings. When in doubt, err on the side of underwatering."

          "description": "Yarrow (Achillea millefolium 'Paprika') requires 6 to 8 hours of direct sunlight each day for it to thrive. It is best to grow this plant in full sun, as it needs the bright light to produce the best flower and leaf color. If the plant is kept in an area with partial shade for too long, it will not bloom as profusely. Direct sunlight will also help to keep Yarrow 'Paprika' from getting leggy. Ideally, the plant should receive direct sunlight from sunrise to mid-morning each day."

          "description": "Yarrow (Achillea millefolium 'Paprika') should be pruned in early spring. Pruning too late can delay blooming, so it is best to prune before the start of new growth. To achieve bushy growth, start by pruning off the main stem just above a set of buds. Cut back any secondary stems that are significantly taller than other stems. Generally, no more than 1/3 of the plantâ€™s total height should be pruned. Remove any dead or damaged stems, as well as any shoots that are crossing or competing with each other and thin out any overcrowded stems. Once the initial pruning is completed, remove spent blooms lightly throughout the summer as necessary to help promote reblooming."
