          "description": "Water the National Chinese Dogwood (Cornus kousa 'National') when the top of the soil is dry to the touch. This variety of dogwood thrives in moist, well-draining soil and should be watered deeply about once a week during the summer months. In the winter, the soil can be allowed to dry out slightly more between waterings. Be careful not to overwater, as this can cause root rot. Make sure the soil is moist but not soggy."

          "description": "National Chinese Dogwood (Cornus kousa 'National') requires full sun to partial shade. An ideal amount of sunlight for the National Chinese Dogwood would be a minimum of 4 to 6 hours of direct sun each day and 5 to 7 hours with some protection from the afternoon sun. Too little sun will reduce flowering while too much can cause foliage burn, especially during hot, dry summers. The best time for the National Chinese Dogwood to get direct sun is in the morning, with some afternoon protection when possible."

          "description": "National Chinese Dogwood (Cornus kousa 'National') should be pruned in early spring before new growth begins. Pruning should be done sparingly, as it can reduce flowering and fruit production. However, selective pruning can help shape branches and remove any dead or damaged branches. 1/3  of the oldest branches should be removed to stimulate the growth of new, strong branches. When pruning, take care not to remove too much of the plantâ€™s foliage or it may become top heavy and more susceptible to wind damage."
