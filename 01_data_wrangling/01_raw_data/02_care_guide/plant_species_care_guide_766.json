The soil should be kept moist, but not overly saturated. Allow the top 2 inches of soil to dry out between waterings. "

          "description": "Coastal serviceberry (Amelanchier obovalis) prefers full sunlight and is drought-tolerant. For optimal growth and flowering, ideally it should receive 6-7 hours of full sunlight each day either in the morning or the afternoon. During the growing season, it should receive about 8 hours of sun every day. In some climates, it may be better for it to receive some light shade if the temperature is too hot or the soil is very dry. "

          "description": "Coastal serviceberry (Amelanchier obovalis) should be pruned in late winter or early spring (February or March) for best results. Prune lightly, removing no more than 1/3 of the previous years growth. Remove any dead, diseased, or damaged branches. Cut back long stems to the desired shape or reduce the overall size of the plant. Remove any low-growing shoots from the base of the trunk. This will promote better air circulation and allow light to penetrate the center of the plant. Do not prune too severely as this will reduce the amount of blooms the plant produces."
