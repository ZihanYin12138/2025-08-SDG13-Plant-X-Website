          "description": "Ouachita Mountain leadplants require regular watering to thrive. It is best to water them thoroughly but infrequently. During the summer months, these plants should be watered once a week. However, in cases of extreme heat, they may require more frequent watering. During the winter months, water once every 2-3 weeks. It is important not to over-water these plants - too much water can cause rot and potential death. As always, make sure to check the soil moisture, as this will tell you when it is time to water again."

          "description": "The Ouachita Mountain leadplant typically needs 5-6 hours of direct sunlight every day during its growing season. It will benefit from partial sun and shade during its hottest times but requires more consistent direct sunlight during the cooler months. Additionally, when the Ouachita Mountain leadplant is grown indoors, it should be placed near a window so that it can receive some natural sunlight."

          "type": "pruning",
          "description": "The Ouachita Mountain leadplant should be pruned seasonally, in late winter or early spring just before the new growth begins. Prune lightly to remove dead and damaged branches and to reduce the overall size of the plant. For larger trees or shrubs, prune back approximately 1/3 of the branches. It is important to prune the Ouachita Mountain leadplant selectively, taking great care to avoid cutting too much at a time. Pruning too heavily or too frequently can deplete the plant's energy reserves and can negatively impact its growth."
