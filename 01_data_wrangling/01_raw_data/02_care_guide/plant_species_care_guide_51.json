          "description": "Water deeply and infrequently when the soil is dry to the touch, approximately once every 1-2 weeks. It's best to divide the amount of water into several sessions to ensure that the water fully penetrates the root system. Make sure to use room temperature water when watering. Avoid saturating the soil or standing water. During very hot weather, it may be necessary to water more frequently."

          "description": "Coonara Pygmy Japanese Maple (Acer palmatum ‘Coonara Pygmy’) does best when it receives light throughout the day. It benefits from at least 4-6 hours of sun each day, with the ideal amount of direct sunlight reaching the plant during the morning hours. This cultivar can also tolerate dappled shade for a portion of the day. Too much direct or intense sun exposure can cause the foliage to scorch."

          "description": "Coonara Pygmy Japanese Maple should be pruned in late winter or early spring, when the plant is in a state of dormancy. Pruning should be light and should focus primarily on removing dead, damaged, or diseased branches. It is also a good idea to prune off any low-hanging limbs, branches that are crossing, or suckers emerging from the base of the tree. In general, it is best to avoid pruning more than 1/3 of the total height of the tree, as this can create an imbalance in the tree’s structure."
