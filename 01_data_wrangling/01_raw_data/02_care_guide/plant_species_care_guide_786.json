          "description": "Blue Star (Amsonia tabernaemontana 'Montana') should be watered moderately. During the spring and summer, the plant should be watered around once a week, depending on the temperature and how quickly the soil dries out. In the autumn, water should only be given every 2 weeks (or less). During the winter, Blue Star doesn't need to be watered as it enters a state of dormancy, meaning it should only be watered every 2-3 months. Make sure your soil is well-draining, so the roots don't sit in moist soil too long, as this could cause root rot. "

          "description": "Blue Star plants (Amsonia tabernaemontana 'Montana') prefer to receive full sun, or 6 to 8 hours of direct sunlight, during the spring and summer months. During the autumn and winter, they need at least 4 hours of direct sun each day. Too much shade may cause the plantâ€™s foliage to become weak and leggy. Although Blue Star plants may tolerate partial shade, they should not be planted in shady locations or overly shaded areas."

          "description": "Blue star plants should be pruned twice a year, once in late winter or early spring and again in mid-summer. For both pruning sessions, remove up to 1/3 of the oldest stems at their base. This will help the plant to maintain a compact form, prevent it from becoming too woody, and promote branching and the production of flowers. Dead or damaged stems should also be removed as needed."
