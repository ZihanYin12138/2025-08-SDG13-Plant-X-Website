          "description": "Love-lies-bleeding plants prefer moist soil and should be watered deeply and consistently. Water when the top 1-2 inches of soil is dry. During periods of extreme heat, they should be watered twice a week or more. Always make sure to avoid over-watering, as this can lead to root rot. In cooler climates, these plants may need less water. If you're unsure when to water, feel the soilâ€”if it's dry and you can't feel any moisture a few inches down, it's time to water."

          "description": "Love-lies-bleeding (Amaranthus caudatus) does well in full sun and prefers 6 to 8 hours of direct sunlight per day. It is also tolerant to partial shade, hence receiving 4 to 6 hours of sunlight a day should also suffice. It is important to note that during the hottest part of the day, providing some shade to the plant is beneficial."

          "description": "Love-lies-bleeding (Amaranthus caudatus) should be pruned twice a season. During the spring, when the plant is 2 to 3 weeks old, remove any dead or brittle stems or leaves. This helps to ensure that the plant gets a good start in the season. In the late summer, prune the plant back to 12-18 inches to prevent it from becoming leggy and promote new growth and flower production. Make sure to use clean and sharp pruning shears to ensure a clean cut. To promote a bushier, fuller look, pinch stem tips back just before the plants bloom. Clear away dead or diseased stems or foliage as needed during the season to maintain a healthy and attractive plant."
