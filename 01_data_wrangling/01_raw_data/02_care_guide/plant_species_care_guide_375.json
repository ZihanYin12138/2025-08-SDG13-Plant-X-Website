          "description": "Norland Apple plants should be watered deeply and evenly twice a week during the growing season. About 1-2 inches of water per week is sufficient, and it is best to water in the morning to reduce evaporation and better allow the water to reach the root system. In addition to the regular weekly watering, it is important to water deeply during extended periods of dry spells. During the winter months, it is best to reduce watering to once a month or less."

However, if the temperature exceeds 90Â°F it's best to provide some shade to the plant. For best results, arrange for the sunlight to fall on Norland Apple between 11am and 5pm, when the sun is at its strongest."

          "description": "Norland Apple should be pruned in late winter, early spring, before the tree leafs out. For mature Norland Apples, up to 1/3 of the branches should be removed each year during this pruning period. For young trees, pruning should be slightly gentler, and should gradually increase year by year until the desired shape is achieved. To keep the tree healthy, all dead or diseased branches should be removed, and the tree should be thinned out to allow air to circulate and sunlight to penetrate. The goal of pruning should be to create a strong central leader and well-spaced scaffold branches."
