The amount of water should be enough to thoroughly soak the roots. Additionally, during the winter seasonl, the plant should be watered deeply every 2-3 weeks.

          "description": "Beni Otake Japanese Maple (Acer palmatum 'Beni Otake') should be pruned during late winter or early spring. Pruning should be kept to a minimum as this tree does not respond well to pruning that results in major changes in shape and size. Light trimming of dead or diseased branches is recommended. To maintain its compact shape, Beni Otake may be trimmed lightly to remove any branches that detract from the overall shape of the tree."
