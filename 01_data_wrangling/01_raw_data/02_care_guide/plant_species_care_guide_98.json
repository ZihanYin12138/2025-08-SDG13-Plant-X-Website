          "description": "During the spring and summer when the tree is actively growing, it should typically be watered deeply 2 or 3 times each week. During the dry summer months, it is recommended to water the tree once every 4 to 5 days, except in extremely hot and dry areas, where it may need to be watered more frequently. In autumn, water the tree about once every 10 days and in winter, water it about once a month. Make sure to never let the soil become overly wet or dry, as both conditions can lead to poor growth or death of the tree."

          "description": "Pendulum Julian Japanese maple is a full-sun species of tree and should receive direct sunlight for at least 6 to 8 hours each day. During the summer months, it is best to keep the tree in an area where it will receive full morning sun and some shaded afternoon sun. In colder winter climates, it may benefit from some additional full sun exposure in order to avoid chill damage to the foliage. Additionally, the tree should also be provided with protection from strong, drying winds as this could also lead to foliage damage."

          "description": "Pendulum Julian Japanese Maple should be pruned in late spring or early summer, after the leaves have emerged. This will encourage new growth. Start by removing any dead, diseased, or crossing branches. You can also remove any branch that is too large for the rest of the plant and is taking away from the natural shape of the tree. Finally, thin out any branches that are too dense, as this will help create air flow. When pruning, make sure not to take away more than 1/3 of the total foliage."
