          "description": "Autumn Gold Ginkgo (Ginkgo biloba 'Autumn Gold') should be watered every week or 2, allowing the top several inches of soil to dry out in between watering. When watering your Autumn Gold Ginkgo, it is important to give the entire rootball an even soak. Adding too much water or watering too often leads to the rootball sitting in a pool of water and a decrease in oxygen levels, which can harm the plant. For best results, water slowly, providing enough time for the water to soak down to the plant's roots."

          "description": "Autumn Gold Ginkgo (Ginkgo biloba 'Autumn Gold') thrive in sunny or partially shaded locations, with 4 or more hours of direct sunlight a day. During the summer months, this plant species can tolerate full sun, though it should be provided with some shade during the hottest hours of the day. In the winter, the plant should be in a location that receives at least 2 hours of direct sunlight for optimal growth. Additionally, it is important to avoid locations that receive reflected sunlight, as these can burn the leaves of an Autumn Gold Ginkgo."

          "description": "Autumn Gold Ginkgo should be pruned once or twice a year, in late winter or early spring. Pruning should consist of removing dead or damaged branches, as well as any competing or overlapping branches to create a healthy, balanced growth habit. To maintain its shape, small to moderate amounts of pruning can also be done prior to each new growth season. To minimize stress to the tree, prune no more than 1/3 of its total foliage mass. This will ensure that the tree remains strong and healthy. Also, avoid doing extensive pruning during the summer months as it could shock the tree and impede its growth."
