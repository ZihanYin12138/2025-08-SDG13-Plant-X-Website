          "description": "Snowbush plants should be regularly watered and should not be allowed to dry out completely, as this will lead to wilting and leaf drop. In the growing season, water the plant on average of once every week to 10 days. In the winter months, when the plant is dormant, reduce the frequency of watering to about once every 2 weeks. To determine if your snowbush needs water, feel the soil. If the soil feels dry when touched, the plant needs water. Water the plant until liquid runs through the drainage holes of the pot. Discard any excess from the collecting saucer beneath the pot to avoid root rot."

          "description": "A Snowbush plant species (Breynia disticha) prefers to receive direct sunlight for about 4 to 6 hours a day. While it does prefer the sun, it is important to keep in mind that too much sun can cause the leaves to burn. The best time of day for the snowbush to receive sunlight is early in the morning or late in the afternoon. In hotter climates, it is important to provide the plant with some shade during the peak of the day when the sun is at its strongest."

          "description": "Pruning for a snowbush should be done in early spring before new growth begins or after flowering is complete in late spring. The extent of pruning will depend on the size and shape of the plant, as well as your desired look. If the shrub is too large, remove 1/3 to 1/2 of the oldest wood. Medium-sized snowbushes may only need light pruning to remove dead or overgrown branches and shape the bush, while larger and more established specimens should be pruned lightly and selectively to promote health and flowering."
