          "description": "The rough maidenhair fern is a relatively easy-care plant, however, it does require regular watering. During the summer months, it should be watered 3-4 times a week and allowed to dry out slightly between waterings. During the winter, it should be watered once every 7-10 days. When watering the rough maidenhair fern, moisten the soil evenly to ensure even watering. It's important not to overwater the plant, as this can lead to root rot. To tell if your plant needs to be watered, feel the top inch of soil; if it’s dry, it’s time to water."
