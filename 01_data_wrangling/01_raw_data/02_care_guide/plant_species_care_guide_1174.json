          "description": "False indigo should be watered deeply and infrequently. During its first growing season, it should be watered about twice a week to help it become established. During hot and dry weather, it can be watered more frequently. In established beds, water about once per week or every 10 days during hot summer months. During cooler months, the plant can be watered less frequently. It is important to make sure the soil surrounding false indigo is evenly moist but not soggy. Water directly at the base of the plant and avoid wetting the foliage. Leaf scorch can occur if the foliage is left too wet."

          "description": "False indigo (Baptisia 'Chocolate Chip') needs full sun for at least 6 to 8 hours per day. It does best in direct sun during the morning and early afternoon, with partial shade in the afternoon. The plant needs safe, direct exposure to the sun for the majority of the day. It tolerates cooler climates and could survive in temperature as low as 25°F (-4°C). Avoid direct sun exposure for long periods in the afternoon to protect the plant from potential sunburn damage."

          "description": "False indigo (baptisia 'Chocolate Chip') should be pruned back in early spring, before new growth appears. This should be done with care as false indigo can be very slow growing. It is best to remove only about a third of the growth of the previous season for your false indigo. Any broken, diseased, or dead stems should be trimmed off and/or removed completely. Trimming the stems back to a point of vigorous foliage is also beneficial. This will help the plant grow into a more compact shape and keep it from becoming too leggy."
