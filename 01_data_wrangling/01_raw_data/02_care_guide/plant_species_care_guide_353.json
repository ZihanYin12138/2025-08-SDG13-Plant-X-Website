Water the Belle de Boskoop Apple once or twice a week in the summer with a deep thorough soaking, and once or twice a month in the winter when temperatures fall below freezing. Avoid watering the tree during rainy weather."

This type of apple tree thrives best in bright sun, so planting in a location that receives as much direct sunlight as possible throughout the day will ensure your apple tree is producing the healthiest fruit possible."

          "description": "Belle de Boskoop apples should be pruned in early spring when the buds have just become visible. Start by thinning out any dead, diseased or crossed branches and then prune to an open center. Bring your cuts just below leaf or bud clusters to maximize light and air penetration. Cut back any strong, vigorously growing shoots to encourage more balanced growth. Remove any small-diameter water sprouts that are growing straight up in the center of the tree. Cut away any crossed, rubbing or weak branches. To keep the tree in its natural shape, remove no more than 1/3 of the plant's growth each pruning session. Pruning should be done every 3-4 years to promote fruit production and ensure a healthy and productive tree in the future."
