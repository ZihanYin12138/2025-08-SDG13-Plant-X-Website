          "description": "Watering Boxwood plants need to be done on a regular basis to keep them healthy and growing. Most Boxwood plants require about 1-2 inches of water per week during the growing season, either from rainfall or by providing supplemental irrigation. It is important to not over water the plant â€“ allowing the soil to dry slightly between watering is recommended. During the wintertime, the water needs for Boxwood plants are minimal, but if there is a long dry period, it is helpful to occasionally give the plants a thorough watering."

          "description": "Boxwood (Buxus microphylla 'Compacta') grows best in bright, indirect sunlight. It should receive several hours of direct sunlight a day, but not too long, especially in the afternoon hours when the sun is the strongest. For best results, it should get at least 3 to 4 hours of direct morning sunlight each day, with the option of dappled or indirect light for the rest of the day to prevent sunburn. If it's grown indoors, it should be placed in a location that receives plenty of sunlight throughout the day."

          "description": "For Boxwood (Buxus microphylla 'Compacta'), pruning should take place twice a year; in early spring (March) and in late summer (August/September). Pruning should be done lightly and strategically, removing only a small portion of the growth. This will help maintain the desired size and shape of the shrub while avoiding damaging the plant's health. When pruning, keep in mind that removing more than 25% of growth should be avoided. Removing too much of the plant's growth will reduce the number of leaves it can photosynthesize with, which can ultimately reduce the health of the plant. Additionally, it's important to make sure the pruning shears are sharp to avoid tearing the branches of the plant, which can lead to infection and disease."
