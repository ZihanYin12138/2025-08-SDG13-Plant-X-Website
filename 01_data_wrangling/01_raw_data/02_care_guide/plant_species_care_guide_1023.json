          "description": "Watering is an important part of keeping Sprenger's asparagus fern (Asparagus densiflorus) healthy. The best way to keep the soil consistently moist is to water the soil once a week, taking care to evenly moisten the soil to a depth of 8-10 cm (3-4 inches). Additionally, watch for signs of dryness in the top couple of centimeters of soil and water accordingly. During periods of intense summer heat, an extra watering may be necessary. It is also important to never allow the soil to dry out completely at any time. "

          "description": "Sprenger's asparagus fern (Asparagus densiflorus) prefers bright indirect sunlight. Direct sunlight will cause the foliage to bleach and burn, so placing the plant in a location where it gets 4 to 5 hours of sunlight a day is ideal. It is important to note that the sunlight should indirectly reach the plant; in other words, placing it near a window that has a sheer curtain that will defuse the sunlight or a window that gets morning sun but has shade during the afternoon is optimal for this species."

          "description": "Pruning for Sprenger's asparagus fern (Asparagus densiflorus) should be done in late spring or early summer. Prune sparingly, removing only dead foliage and stems. Cut stems back to their base and remove any dead leaves, but leave the healthy stems and foliage intact. Prune oddly-shaped, spindly or dead stems and cut them off flush with the soil. Prune to remove any brown, mushy, or discolored leaves and stems. Prune during the warmer months of the year to encourage fresh, healthy growth."
