          "description": "This plant species should be watered deeply once a week, making sure the soil stays moist but not saturated. Generally, deep watering can be done by running a hose at the base of the tree for about 10 minutes, or by using a watering can that delivers a steady stream of water for the same amount of time. In addition, during the summer months, it is beneficial to water your Gold Rider Leyland Cypress twice a week to ensure that the soil does not dry out too quickly. "

For optimal health, having a few hours of unfiltered sunlight in the morning and in the late afternoon would be beneficial for this species of plant. During the summer months when the sun is strongest, the plant can benefit from some light shade in the early afternoon in order to prevent it from overheating."

          "description": "Gold Rider Leyland Cypress should be pruned every 2 years, in late winter or early spring. Begin pruning by removing any dead or damaged branches. Next, thin out the interior so that the tree has an open, airy appearance. The remaining branches should be cut to the desired shape, while making sure to retain a balanced look. When pruning, aim to keep the top of the tree narrower than the bottom. If the tree becomes overgrown, it can be subjected to a hard prune, reducing the height by 1/3 or more and spread by 1/2 or more. Always make sure to use sharp tools and make clean cuts to avoid damaging the plant."
