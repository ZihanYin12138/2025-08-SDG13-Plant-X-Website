Water them once every 10-14 days, making sure that the soil stays evenly moist (not wet), and dry out slightly between waterings. If the plant is in a container that has adequate drainage, it is best to soak the entire container in a sink, allowing the water to run freely through the holes in the bottom of the pot. During the summer, water more frequently as needed. "

For regular maintenance, remove any dead or damaged leaves, stems, and flower heads. To encourage bushier growth and fuller blooms, cut back the stems to about 4-6 inches in mid to late summer. Additionally, you can cut off the spent blooms to keep the plant looking tidy and encourage fresh growth."
