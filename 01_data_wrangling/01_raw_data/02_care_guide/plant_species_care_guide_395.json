          "description": "Norway Spruce should be watered up to 2 inches of water once a week during the growing season (April through October). Depending on the temperature and humidity, supplemental water during the summer may be necessary if rains are scarce. Make sure to give the soil thorough soakings so that the water is penetrating deeply and reaching the roots. During the winter months, water is not necessary - your Norway Spruce should be able to get the sustenance it needs from the snow and rain."

          "description": "Norway Spruce requires full sunlight for optimal growth and health. This species prefers to receive at least 6 hours of direct sunlight each day during the growing season (May through September). During the winter months, Norway Spruce needs at least 4 hours of indirect sunlight each day. When grown indoors, provide a bright, sunny window and turn the plant regularly so all sides get adequate light."

          "type": "pruning",
          "description": "Generally, Norway Spruce should be pruned in late winter or early spring, before the beginning of active growth in the new season. Pruning should be limited to removing dead, diseased, or broken branches and thinning out crowded branches as needed. Light pruning will also help maintain the form of the Norway Spruce. Heavy pruning should be avoided, as it can reduce the tree's ability to photosynthesize and cause tip and leader growth to increase in unbalanced proportions."
