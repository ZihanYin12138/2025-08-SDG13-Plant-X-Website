          "description": "Mimosa should be watered thoroughly but infrequently. Water when the soil is dry to a depth of 1 inch and provide enough water to moisten the soil to a depth of at least 8 inches. Avoid overwatering as this can waterlog the soil and drown the roots. A general rule of thumb is to provide around 1-2 inches of water per week. In hotter, drier climates plants may need more frequent watering than those in cooler climates."

          "description": "Mimosa plants thrive in direct sunlight for a minimum of 6 to 8 hours a day to ensure they stay healthy and produce flowers. Ideally, this species should receive sun in the early morning or late afternoon as the direct sunlight during mid-day could scorch the leaves. During the summer months, Mimosa should receive full sun each day."

          "description": "Mimosa (Albizia julibrissin) should be pruned in early spring, before new growth appears. The amount of pruning varies based on the age and size of the plant, but generally about 1/3 to 1/2 of the older stems can be safely removed without harming the plant. If itâ€™s an older plant, more aggressive pruning may be required but should only be done with the advice of a horticultural expert. Other thinning maintenance pruning can be done throughout the year to help maintain the shape and size of the plant."
