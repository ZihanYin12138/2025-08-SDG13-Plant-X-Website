          "description": "Columbine (Aquilegia 'Remembrance') should be watered at least once or twice a week (1-2 gallons) during the growing season. How much water you give will depend on local conditions such as temperature and humidity. The soil should be kept evenly moist but not soggy, and it is important to avoid overwatering as this can cause root rot and fungus. It is also a good idea to check the soil with your finger to make sure that it is evenly moist. Watering should be decreased in the fall and winter months, when growth is slower and the plant requires less water."

          "description": "Columbine (Aquilegia 'Remembrance') is a plant species that prefers partial to full sun. In order to thrive, it needs a minimum of 4 to 6 hours of direct sunlight each day, although it can handle a bit more. It is best to provide the plant with morning sun rather than afternoon sun to prevent scorching late-day sun. During the summer months, it will do well in full sun, while in the winter, it should be provided partial shade."

          "description": "Columbine (Aquilegia 'Remembrance') should be pruned at the beginning of spring, usually when their last year's flowering is starting to fade. Pruning this plant should only be done very lightly, as it may reduce its tendency to re-bloom that season. In general, you should remove only the dead and damaged stems, or those that look overcrowded and are not flowering. Removing no more than a 1/3 of the plant is usually recommended for pruning Columbine."
