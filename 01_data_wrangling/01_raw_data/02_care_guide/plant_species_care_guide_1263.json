Morning sunlight is best, as full afternoon sun may scorch the foliage. If possible, position your Bergenia DRAGONFLY ANGEL KISS in a spot that receives sun in the morning followed by shade in the afternoon."

          "description": "Pruning of Bergenia DRAGONFLY ANGEL KISS should be done in late spring or early summer when it has finished flowering. Prune the overlong stems and remove any dead foliage. It is recommended to only prune up to 1/3 of the plant in order to retain its shape and size. Excess pruning can reduce the blooms. If the Bergenia plant has become too large it can be cut back to its initial size."
