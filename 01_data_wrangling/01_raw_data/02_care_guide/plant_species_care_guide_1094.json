          "description": "Astilbe 'Verscarmine' Younique Carmine should be watered lightly every 1-2 days during active growth and flowering periods. It is important to provide the plant with sufficient water without overwhelming it. When the soil around the plant becomes dry to the touch, it is time to water. During the dormant period, the plant should only be watered enough to keep it from wilting. If rainfall is abundant, then additional water may not be necessary. Watch for signs of drooping foliage or yellowed leaves to determine if the plant is in need of additional watering."

          "description": "Astilbe ‘Vercarmine’ Younique Carmine prefers full sun in the morning and partial shade in the afternoon. The plant should receive at least 4 hours of direct sunlight a day. Direct sunlight during the hottest part of the day (midday) should be avoided due to the possibility of foliage burn. Planting in a spot that has shade in the midday will help protect this plant from damage. When the weather is hotter, Astilbe ‘Vercarmine’ Younique Carmine may need additional shade in the afternoon."

          "description": "Astilbe 'Verscarmine' YOUNIQUE CARMINE is a delicate perennial flowering plant that needs proper pruning to maintain its shape and fall bloom. Pruning should be done in late winter or early spring for best results. To begin, remove any dead or damaged foliage and any flower spikes that remain from the previous season. Then, cut back the plant to just a few inches above the ground. This will allow for healthy new growth and abundant flowering when the growing season begins. The foliage of Astilbe 'Verscarmine' YOUNIQUE CARMINE can be lightly trimmed after flowering to remove any discolored or damaged foliage. This will help keep the plant looking neat and vibrant."
