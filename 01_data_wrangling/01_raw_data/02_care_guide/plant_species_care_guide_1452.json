          "description": "Korean boxwood (Buxus sinica var. insularis 'Wintergreen') should be watered deeply but not often. During the spring and summer months, water twice per week, allowing the soil to become slightly dry between each watering. In the fall and winter months, water only once a month. If the soil has become overly dry, an extra watering may be required. Avoid overwatering, as this can lead to root rot and other issues with the plant."

          "description": "Korean boxwood (Buxus sinica var. insularis 'Wintergreen') require bright, indirect sunlight â€” at least a few hours of direct light a day, along with 6-8 hours of indirect sunlight. Providing Korean boxwood with too much direct sunlight in summer can damage the leaves, and too little can slow growth. During the spring and summer months, it may benefit from being placed in full sunlight for a few hours each day. During the winter, it only needs as much light as available from a south- or southwest-facing window."

          "description": "Korean boxwood (Buxus sinica var. insularis 'Wintergreen') requires periodic pruning in order to maintain a neat, dense shape. The best time to prune these plants is in early spring, after the last frost has passed. Pruning should be done in small increments and only occasional light pruning should be done outside of this period. When pruning, remove only about 1/3 of the overall growth each time, and avoid pruning too much at once. It is okay to prune branches back to anywhere from 1/2 inch to 2 inches in length, but do not prune branches so that they become shorter than 1/2 inch. Doing so could leave gaps or thin out the foliage."
