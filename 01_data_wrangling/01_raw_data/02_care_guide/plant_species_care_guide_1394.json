During the summer months, water only if the plant appears wilted or droopy. Do not water if the soil is already moist. In the winter, when it's not growing vigorously, reduce watering to every 2-3 weeks. Provide good drainage and allow the soil to dry out between waterings."

          "description": "Butterfly bush (Buddleja 'Pink Micro Chip') should receive full sun from morning through afternoon for optimum blooms and growth. This plant species prefers long hours of sunlight, at least 8-10 hours per day during the early summer months. In shadier climates, partial sun or some kind of shade is recommended to protect the bush from too much direct sunlight, as intense exposure can often result in the burning of foliage. For best results, focus on finding a location with morning sun exposure and afternoon shade to provide optimal environment for best blooms and plant health."

          "description": "Butterfly bush (Buddleja 'Pink Micro Chip') should be pruned in late winter or early spring before new growth emerges. Pruning should be done in a sweeping motion to just above the point where the stems emerge from the main stem. The amount of pruning should be moderate, cutting away only 2/3 of the tips of the stems. If severe pruning is needed, it is best to split it up over 2 years, removing 1/3 of the stems 1 year, and the remaining 2/3 of stems the following year."
