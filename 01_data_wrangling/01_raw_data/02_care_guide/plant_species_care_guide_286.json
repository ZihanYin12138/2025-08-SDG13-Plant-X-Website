          "description": "The weeping purple beech tree should be watered once a week for best results, with about 1 to 2 gallons of water applied to the soil around it. Water around the tree's base, not on the leaves, and make sure to start watering further away from the trunk to better spread the moisture out. During hot weather, the tree may need extra water and can benefit from an additional deep, soaking application. Be sure to water the tree thoroughly since a light watering is not as effective since it inhibits proper root growth. The tree should be watered 1 to 2 times a week if temperatures remain high. If rains are plentiful, supplemental water should not be necessary."

          "description": "Weeping Purple Beech (Fagus sylvatica 'Purpurea Pendula') should be planted in a location that receives full sunlight in the morning and partial shade during the afternoon. It prefers 6-8 hours of direct sunlight and thrives in cooler temperatures. This species does best when grown in humus-rich, moist soil, but it can handle dry periods. It is a slow grower, so it will require regular pruning to maintain its pendulous shape."

          "description": "Weeping Purple Beech (Fagus sylvatica 'Purpurea Pendula') should be pruned in late winter or early spring to maintain the desired shape and size. Pruning should be gentle and not cut through a large number of the small branching stems. If necessary, larger branches may need to be removed but should be done in small increments over several years. Any heavy pruning should never take away more than 1/3 of the foliage at a time. Pruning back along a central leader is usually sufficient to maintain the desired shape and size. It is important to remove dead or damaged branches. Any shoots that grow up in the middle of the tree should be removed to keep the tree open and let in light and air."
