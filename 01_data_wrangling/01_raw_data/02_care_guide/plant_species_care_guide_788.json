          "description": "Blue star (Amsonia tabernaemontana 'Storm Cloud') is a popular variety of ornamental plant, due to its light airy blue-green foliage and its compact habit. This plant species prefers full sun to part-shade, and should receive at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily in order to thrive. If planted in a spot that receives more sun than the recommended amount, supplemental watering will be necessary to prevent wilting and sunburn. Planting this species in shade may cause the leaves to turn a darker green and the plants may not reach their full mature height."

          "description": "Blue Star (Amsonia tabernaemontana 'Storm Cloud') should be pruned once a year in late spring or early summer, after blooming has stopped. Pruning should involve removing dead, diseased, or overgrown branches/stems. When possible, cutting the stems back to the base of the plant results in a bushier form with increased flowering. This pruning should also help to keep the plant within its desired size and shape."
