          "description": "Leonard Messel Magnolia plants should be watered regularly during the growing season (spring and summer) in order to keep the soil moist, but not soggy. The soil should be allowed to dry slightly between waterings. It is best to give the plant a deep soaking of 1-2 inches of water once or twice a week, providing it with 1-2 gallons of water at each watering. The magnolia should also be given a deep watering every 10-14 days during the winter months, when temperatures drop and rainfall is sparse."

          "description": "Leonard Messel Magnolia plants need about 6 hours of direct sunlight each day for optimal growth. If planted in an area where the sunlight is limited, they can thrive in dappled or partial shade for part of the day. When positioning the magnolia, it is important to take the direction of the sun into account. For maximum flowering, the magnolia should be situated so that it receives the maximum amount of morning sunlight."

          "description": "Leonard Messel Magnolia (Magnolia x loebneri 'Leonard Messel') should be pruned in spring or early summer, once the risk of frost has passed. Pruning should be minimal and used to shape and encourage healthy growth while limiting clutter. To help keep it tidy, thin out any densely growing branches by cutting back 1-third of the growth from the end of the branches. Dead, diseased, crossed, or intertwined branches should also be removed."
