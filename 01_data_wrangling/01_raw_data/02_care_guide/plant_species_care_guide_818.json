Make sure that the top layer of soil has become dry before watering again. You may need to water more often during periods of extreme heat. In general, water in the morning or the evening, whenever the temperature is cooler."

          "description": "Windflower (Anemone hybrida 'Andrea Atkinson') prefers full or partial sun. It will benefit from 4 to 6 hours of sunlight a day. Morning sunlight is more beneficial for the plant, as it prevents wilting and bolsters flower production. If provided with too much direct sunlight, the plant may become damaged and its blooming will be affected, so it is important to find a balance between providing the sun it needs and not over-exposing it. Ultimately, always consider the plant’s individual needs and the best lighting based on your location."

          "description": "Windflower (Anemone hybrida 'Andrea Atkinson') should be pruned twice a year, in early spring before new growth emerges, and in late summer or early fall after blooming. In spring, prune off any dead or diseased branches, and cut back the rest to a healthy bud or branch. In late summer, reduce the overall height of the plant by cutting back all stems to just a few inches above the ground. Pruning should be light and should never remove more than 1/3 of the plant’s total growth at 1 time. Additionally, never prune when the plant is drought stressed."
