          "description": "Hollyhocks require consistent moisture to thrive. They should be watered once or twice per week depending on the weather conditions. During hot and dry months, water the plants every 3-4 days. Water around the base of the plant where foliage meets the soil, rather than sprinkling water from above. Soaking the plant's roots ensures the water is reaching the root system. Do not overwater, as this can cause the foliage to rot."

          "description": "Hollyhocks (Alcea rosea) prefer at least 5-6 hours of direct sunlight each day, and grow best in a location that receives morning sun and afternoon shade. Too much sun can lead to scorching of the leaves, while too little sun will diminish flowering. If the hollyhock is given too much shade, the flower stalk will get weak and may eventually collapse, so a sunny location is ideal. To ensure optimal flowering and fullness, consider rotating the plant or providing partial shade when possible."

          "description": "Hollyhocks (Alcea rosea) should be pruned in early spring as new growth starts. To encourage bushier growth and overall vigorous health, cut away any dead or weak stems to the base, just above the soil line. Other stems should be pruned back by 1/3 to 1/2 their length. Removing flower stalks as they fade will also help promote healthy foliage growth. Prune regularly throughout the growing season to maintain its shape and encourage more flowers."
