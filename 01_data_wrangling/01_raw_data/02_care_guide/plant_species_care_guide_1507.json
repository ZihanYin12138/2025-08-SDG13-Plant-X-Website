          "description": "Scotch heather (Calluna vulgaris 'Spring Torch') should generally be watered about once a week. Allow the top few inches of soil to dry out in between waterings. Do not let the plant sit in wet soil for too long as this can cause root rot. In hotter temperatures and during periods of direct sunlight, you may need to water more frequently. In cooler temperatures, you may water slightly less often. Monitor the soil conditions and adjust water accordingly."

          "description": "Scotch heather (Calluna vulgaris 'Spring Torch') plants thrive in full sun and require at least 4 to 6 hours daily. If a Scotch heather plant does not receive adequate amounts of sunlight throughout the day, it will not reach its full potential and may struggle to produce flowers or leaves. The best time for a Scotch heather plant to receive sunlight is in the morning and midday, as this will give it the necessary energy to grow and develop. It is important to make sure that the plant is not getting too much direct sunlight at once, as this can cause it to become scorched and damaged."

          "description": "Scotch heather (Calluna vulgaris 'Spring Torch') should be pruned annually late in the summer, typically at the end of August. Pruning should be moderate to light. Remove no more than a third of the stems per plant, taking off the oldest stems first. Pruning may be done with pruning shears, but scissoring is the preferred method as it preserves the mounding shape of the plant. Dead, dried flower heads should also be removed during this time."
