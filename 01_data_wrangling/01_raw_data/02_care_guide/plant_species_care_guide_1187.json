          "description": "Philippine violet (Barleria cristata) should be watered thoroughly once every 7-10 days, depending upon the weather. The soil should be allowed to nearly dry out between waterings and should not be left constantly wet or saturated. In the summer months, increased temperatures and direct sunlight will mean more frequent watering. During periods of extreme or prolonged heat, daily waterings may be necessary. As a general rule, avoid overwatering and allow the top inch or 2 of soil to dry out before watering again. When overwatered, the leaves of the Philippine violet (Barleria cristata) will start to turn yellow and the edges of the pots can form a white salt deposit."

          "description": "Philippine violet (Barleria cristata) needs at least 4 to 5 hours of direct sunlight per day to thrive. The best times of day to give it sunlight is during the morning and early afternoon, when the sun is at its brightest. When providing direct sunlight during these times, it is important to make sure that the plant isn't in direct, beaming sunlight, as this could result in scorching or sunburn. If the sun becomes too powerful, it's best to partially shade the plant or move it into an area with brighter, indirect sunlight."

          "description": "The Philippine violet (Barleria cristata) should be pruned annually, shortly after the flowers fade. Begin by trimming the stems back by up to 1/3 of its original size. This will help to keep the plant full and will encourage the new growth. Lastly, if pruning is done in the late spring or early summer, the plant should be cut back by up to half in order to promote healthy new growth."
