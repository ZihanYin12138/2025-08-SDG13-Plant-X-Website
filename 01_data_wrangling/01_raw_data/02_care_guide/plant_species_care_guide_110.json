          "description": "Ruslyn In The Pink Japanese Maple should be watered deeply when the soil is dry to a depth of 3-4 inches. When the plant is newly planted, it should be watered every day for a couple of weeks, and after that, water it every other day to ensure that its roots are being deeply penetrated with water. After the plant is established, it should be watered 2 to 3 times a week during the growing season. In winter, water it less frequently, as demand for water will be lessened due to slower growth. Take care to ensure that the plant does not dry out during any of the seasons."

          "description": "Ruslyn In The Pink Japanese Maple (Acer palmatum 'Ruslyn In The Pink') thrives in partial shade and dappled sunlight. This plant species requires 4-6 hours of sun each day, ideally in the form of morning sunlight and late afternoon sun. Too much direct sunlight can damage the delicate foliage of this plant species, so it is important to ensure that its environment is not too bright. Additionally, some shade or protection from hot afternoon sun can be beneficial during the summer months."

          "description": "Ruslyn In The Pink Japanese Maple should be pruned in early spring, before new growth in the season appears. Pruning should be minimal and should generally involve removing dead, damaged or crowded foliage. It’s important to avoid deep pruning, as this can harm the plant and stunt growth. When pruning, aim to maintain the plant’s natural shape without drastically changing the aesthetics – removing no more than 1/3 of the branches or branches with multiple trunks. Avoid pruning in late summer, as this can slow hardening off before winter."
