          "description": "Bowhall Red Maple (Acer rubrum 'Bowhall') should generally be watered deeply once a week, or twice a week in warm weather and drought conditions. Make sure to moisten the entire root zone (at least 12 to 15 inches deep) for a mature tree, and less for newly planted trees. It is best to water in the morning to allow the leaves to dry out during the day. In very dry conditions, an additional light watering may be necessary."

          "description": "Bowhall Red Maple (Acer rubrum 'Bowhall') is a deciduous tree that needs at least 6 hours of sunlight per day for optimal health and growth. It should be placed in a part of the garden where it will get morning and late afternoon sun, with some partial shade in the middle of the day. Planting in areas with full sun exposure will help the tree to grow and develop more quickly. "

          "type": "pruning",
          "description": "Bowhall Red Maple should be pruned annually in late winter/early spring, just before new growth emerges. Pruning should be limited to removing dead, dying, or diseased branches, and, when needed, reshaping and thinning out any excessive or overcrowded branches. It is also important to be selective when thinning; young maples may require more pruning than mature trees. Avoid pruning maples heavily while they are still establishing themselves, as this can slow down growth and reduce flowering."
