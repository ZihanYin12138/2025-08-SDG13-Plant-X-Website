In winter, it should only be watered occasionally when the soil begins to feel dry to the touch, around once every 2 to 3 weeks. It is important to not let the soil dry out completely. Allow the top few inches of soil to dry before thoroughly watering again."

          "description": "Alps yarrow (Achillea distans) should generally be pruned in early spring, before new growth begins. This will encourage the plant to produce fresh, new stems and a more upright and bushy shape. When pruning, make sure to remove shoots that are thin or broken and dead or diseased stems. Any shoots that are too long should be cut by about 1-third to promote branching out. It is also important to remove any flowers that have faded or finished blooming, as this will help prevent further flowering and promote new growth."
