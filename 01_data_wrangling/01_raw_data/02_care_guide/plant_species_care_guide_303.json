          "description": "Watering a tree form Pee Gee Hydrangea should be done regularly, but it should not be overly saturated. To keep the plant healthy and vibrant, water deeply about once a week during the summer months. During the winter months, when the plant is dormant, water sparingly. Soak the soil to a depth of at least 8-10 inches when thoroughly watering. Make sure to be careful not to let the water pool or sit on the foliage. Proper drainage is also important for this plant species, so make sure the soil is well-draining. The tree form Pee Gee Hydrangea should also be mulched in order to conserve moisture and prevent weeds."

          "description": "Tree Form Pee Gee Hydrangea should be planted in a location that receives partial to full sun. For best flowering results, the shrub should receive a minimum of 4-6 hours of direct sunlight a day. Too much direct sun, especially in hot climates, may cause the leaves to burn and can decrease the number of blooms on the plant."

          "description": "Pruning your Tree Form Pee Gee Hydrangea (Hydrangea paniculata 'Grandiflora (tree form)') should occur twice per year, once in the late winter (January or February) and then again in late summer (July or August). In late winter, remove any dead or diseased stems and do a general thinning of the branches, cutting them back to within about 12 inches of the ground. In late summer, prune the top of your tree form to maintain the desired shape and size. You can also remove any stem that grows too far out of the desired shape. Prune the outer edges of your Tree Form Pee Gee Hydrangea to keep a rounded shape. Be sure to prune selectively and not take too much off at once."
