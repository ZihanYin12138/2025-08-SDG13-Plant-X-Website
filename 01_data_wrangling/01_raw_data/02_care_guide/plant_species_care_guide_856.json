          "description": "Anthurium crassinervium plants require frequent, but light, watering. During the growing season (from March to October), water your anthurium twice a week in order to keep the soil lightly moist. During the winter (from November to February), water the plant once every 10 days. It's important not to overwater your anthurium, as the plant is susceptible to fungal and root rot. When watering, allow the water to run through completely, and then wait a few days before watering again. Additionally, make sure to use well-draining soil for your anthurium, as this will help prevent overwatering."

          "description": "Anthurium crassinervium, also known as the painted tongue or black velvet anthurium, is a species of flowering plant that requires full to partial sunlight for optimal growth. For optimal health and flowering potential, they should receive 3-4 hours of direct sunlight per day, spread out throughout the day. The morning and late afternoon are best for providing the bloom with the full light intensity without increasing the heat. If your anthurium is getting too much sunlight, its leaves may scorch. Too little sunlight, and the plant will become weak and not thrive. Therefore, it is important to find the right balance of sunlight for your plant."

          "description": "Pruning an Anthurium crassinervium should be done once or twice a year during its growth season– Spring or Summer. Pruning should be done cautiously, removing no more than 1/3 of the plant’s foliage. Doing so will help the plant attain better shape and increase yield. Additionally, any stems that are brown, yellow, or broken should be snipped off to encourage healthy growth."
