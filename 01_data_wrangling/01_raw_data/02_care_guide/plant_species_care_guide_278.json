          "description": "Loquat (Eriobotrya japonica) should be watered every 7-14 days. The amount of water should be adjusted according to the weather conditions and the type of soil. In general, the amount of water needed is approximately 2-3 inches per week. It is best to water deeply so that the root system of the loquat tree has access to sufficient water. However, be sure to avoid over-watering the plant, as this can cause root rot."

If pruning is necessary during the summer or fall months, aim to prune no more than 20% of the prior season's growth. When pruning loquats, aim to thin crowded branches and remove old or dead wood. If possible, prune only the tips or sides of branches to promote a balanced and natural structure."

This plant species does well with about 4-6 hours of full sun or bright, indirect sunlight per day. When grown indoors, loquat should be kept in a location that receives plenty of sunlight, such as a southern- or western-facing window."
