          "description": "Water your giant hyssop (Agastache 'TNAGAPBY' POQUITO BUTTER YELLOW) regularly, when the soil becomes dry to the touch. Depending on environmental conditions, this could be once to twice per week. It is important to water thoroughly each time so that the soil is consistently moist but not soggy. Too much water can cause root rot and other issues. Allow the soil to dry out between waterings. This plant does not do well with standing water."

          "description": "Giant hyssop (Agastache 'TNAGAPBY' POQUITO BUTTER YELLOW) is a great plant for any garden since it loves the sun and requires several hours of sunlight in order to thrive. The plant should ideally get full sun for the better part of the day, somewhere between 6 to 8 hours of direct sunlight if possible. It's best to expose the Giant hyssop to the morning sun since too much exposure to afternoon sun can cause the leaves to burn or the blooms to fade. If a plant is not getting enough sunlight, it wonâ€™t bloom."

          "description": "Giant hyssop (Agastache 'TNAGAPBY' POQUITO BUTTER YELLOW) should be pruned twice a year. The first pruning should take place in the spring just after the plant has finished flowering and is starting to show new growth. During this pruning, take off any dead or weakened stems, remove any old blooms, and shape the plant as desired. The second pruning should be done in mid-summer after the plant has filled out and is showing its strongest growth. During this pruning, again remove any dead or weakened stems, and shape the plant as desired. Pruning should generally be light, removing no more than 1/3 of the plant at a time."
