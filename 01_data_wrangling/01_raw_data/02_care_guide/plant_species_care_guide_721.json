          "description": "Watering a Aloe harlana plant should be done only when the soil has dried out from the previous watering. It should be watered deeply but infrequently - about once a month, and no more than every 2 weeks. When watering an aloe plant, use enough water to saturate the soil, but avoid overwatering it. You can check the soil with the back of your finger to make sure it is completely dry before you water it again."

          "description": "Aloe harlana needs bright, indirect sunlight for optimal growth. Place the aloe in an east or a west-facing window for optimal growth. For best results, provide 6-8 hours of bright sunlight daily. On bright, hot summer days, provide some shade by partially drawing a window curtain. Too much direct sunlight can burn the leaves. During the winter, the plant may not need direct sunlight due to a decreased intensity of the sun. Keep in mind that all Aloe species need some light to thrive, so a lack of light can cause the plant to become weak and may lead to stunted growth."

          "description": "Pruning of Aloe harlana should be done at least once a year, preferably in the spring when the weather begins to warm up. Pruning should be limited to removing any dead or diseased leaves and tidying up the plant's overall appearance. A hard pruning should only be done if you are replacing an older plant and need to reduce its size. If you do choose to hard prune, limit it to no more than 1-third of the plant's total height."
