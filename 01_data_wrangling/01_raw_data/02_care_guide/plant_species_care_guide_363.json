During the summer, watering might need to be increased to 2-3 inches per week. Apples are generally drought-tolerant, but you should water more during extended periods of hot, dry weather. During the dormant season (late winter to early spring) the tree should be watered only once every 3 to 4 weeks."

During the winter, Golden Delicious Apple trees need at least 4 hours of sunlight per day in order to stay healthy. Even during the summer, the trees need some periods of shade in order to protect them from heat stress."

          "description": "Golden Delicious Apple (Malus 'Golden Delicious') should be pruned in early to mid-spring, with a pruning intensity of approximately 1/3 of the total growth of the tree. The process of pruning should remove any crossed branches, overcrowded branches, and dead or diseased growth. As the plant matures, additional pruning can be done in early to mid-summer to further shape the crown of the tree. All pruning cuts should be made just above a bud or branch intersection."
