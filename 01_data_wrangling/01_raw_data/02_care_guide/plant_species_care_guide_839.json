          "description": "Tall Kangaroo Paw (Anigozanthos flavidus) require regular watering to ensure healthy growth. Water your Tall Kangaroo Paw approximately once every 1 to 2 weeks in the summer months, and then make sure to increase watering to 2 to 3 times a week in the winter months. Make sure that the soil is dried out between waterings and keep an eye on plants during spells of extreme heat.\n\nFertilize your Tall Kangaroo Paw every 6-8 weeks using a slow release fertilizer or liquid fertilizer that is high in nitrogen, potassium, and other essential micronutrients. Do not fertilizewhen temperatures are 90°F and above.\n\nIf you’re growing the plants in containers, water them thoroughly and then allow the top 4-5 cm of the soil to dry out before watering again. The soil should never become completely dry, however, as this will cause the plant to become stressed and can eventually lead to its death. Avoid overwatering as well which can lead to root rot."

          "description": "Tall kangaroo paw (Anigozanthos flavidus) thrives best in full sun, meaning an area with direct, uninterrupted sunlight for 6 to 8 hours each day in order to maintain optimal health. This species can also benefit from some partial shade throughout the day, particularly if the area is hot and humid. For best results, consider providing morning sun along with afternoon shade. As with all plants, adjust this sunlight schedule to keep your Tall Kangaroo Paw as healthy and vigorous as possible."

          "description": "Tall kangaroo paw (Anigozanthos flavidus) should be pruned annually, cutting back all stems to a height of 1 third to 1 half of the original size. This should be done in late winter or early spring before new growth begins. Dead or damaged foliage should be removed during the pruning, as well as any overly long or leggy stems. The pruning process can also help to encourage flowering the next season."
