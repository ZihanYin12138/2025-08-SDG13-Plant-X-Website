          "description": "False indigo (Baptisia 'Ivory Towers') requires regular watering in order to thrive. During the growing season, give the plant 1 to 2 inches of water per week, either from rainfall or from your garden hose. It is important to avoid over-watering as this can cause root rot. If possible, water the plant in the morning on a regular basis to prevent root rot.\n\nDuring the winter, reduce watering to about 1 inch per month. This will help to keep the plant dormant. During periods of drought, increase the amount of water given to keep the soil moist. If the soil feels dry, add additional water until moisture is restored.\n\nOverall, false indigo (Baptisia 'Ivory Towers') can tolerate occasional periods of dryness, but regular watering will ensure healthy growth and abundant blooms."

          "type": "sunlight",
          "description": "False indigo (Baptisia 'Ivory Towers') prefers a minimum of 8 hours of full sun to partial shade, which means that it should be in direct sunlight for at least 8 hours per day. It does best in climates where there are hot summers in combination with mild winters. This plant does not do well in colder climates, so if you can give it a protected position with some shelter, such as on the south side of a building, it will benefit. During the summer, the plant should be in direct sunlight between 10am and 4pm and should be shaded in the late afternoon to reduce the risk of sunburn. In cooler climates, the plant's sunlight needs should be adjusted accordingly. In very hot climates it might be best to move the plant into dappled shade during the hottest part of the day or to provide shade cloth over it."

          "description": "False indigo (Baptisia 'Ivory Towers') requires minimal pruning. It can be pruned in early spring just after new growth has begun, or during the late summer dormant season. Pruning too late in the season can affect the shape and size of next season's blooms. \n\nFor a false indigo, prune away any dead or infested stems or leaves. It is also beneficial to cut out any shoots competing with the center of the plant. Pruning should be done carefully, as too much could damage the plant. \n\nFalse indigo responds well to light pruning, which involves removing 1/3 of old woody stems. This should be done annually in early spring and summer when blooming has finished. This type of pruning will help maintain the plant's form and structure. \n\nOverall, false indigo is a hardy plant and minimal pruning is necessary. Pruning should be done in early spring or late summer, and be careful not to prune too aggressively. This will help keep the plant healthy and vibrant for years to come."
