          "description": "Alternate-leaved butterfly bush (Buddleja alternifolia) should be watered once a week, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Water thoroughly, soaking the soil to a depth of 8-12 inches and ensuring that the water penetrates to the roots. During periods of extreme heat and drought, water more frequently to ensure that the plants can cope. To check if the plant needs water, insert your finger into the soil - if it feels dry, it needs watering."

          "description": "Alternate-leaved butterfly bush (Buddleja alternifolia) requires ample sunlight for optimal growth. Plants should receive at least 6 hours of direct sunlight every day, with 8-12 hours being ideal. Plants should be placed in a location where they will receive direct sunlight for most of the day, such as near south or west-facing windows or in an outdoor location that receives direct sun without any shading. If the plant does not receive direct sunlight for an extended period of time, it can result in poor growth, poor flowering, and an overall unsatisfactory appearance."

          "description": "The alternate-leaved butterfly bush (Buddleja alternifolia) should be pruned twice a year at the end of the winter and early summer. Pruning should be done to remove dead, unhealthy, or stray growth. Winter pruning should be done when the leaves have dropped – around March in temperate climates – while early summer pruning can be done in late May or early June. For both pruning sessions, prune off up to 1/3 of the top growth in order to encourage more bushy growth. Remove any dead, diseased, or damaged growth, as well as any excess stems. Make sure to plan and shape the bushes before pruning, paying attention to the air circulation and light and prune accordingly. Do not prune any stems less than a pencil-thickness in width, as these are needed for flowering. Pruning should be done with sharp, clean shears to ensure that cuts are made cleanly and easily. After pruning, fertilize your Butterfly bush to encourage healthy new growth."
