          "description": "Wax gourds thrive best when watered deeply but infrequently. Aim to provide the plant with 1-2 inches of water per week, distributing the water evenly around the base of the gourd's plant. Depending on sunny and moist weather, it may be beneficial to water slightly more or less. Wax gourds should also be given plenty of air circulation to help reduce potential moisture issues from overwatering."

          "description": "The wax gourd (Benincasa hispida) needs full sunlight in order to thrive and produce its best results. It should be exposed to direct sunlight for at least 6–8 hours a day. This plant should not be grown in shady or partially shaded conditions. Place your wax gourd plant near a south-facing window or on the patio where it can get direct light for most of the day. Make sure you protect it from strong winds too."

          "description": "The wax gourd (Benincasa hispida) can be pruned once a year or as needed. Pruning should generally be done in the early spring before active growth begins. On younger plants, this may be just a slight trimming of the previous season’s growth. For older plants, more drastic pruning can be done to remove dead or unwanted branches or to control the size. It is important to make clean cuts when pruning wax gourd plants to help promote new healthy growth. Remove only a 1/3 to a 1/2 of the total foliage to prevent shock to the plant."
