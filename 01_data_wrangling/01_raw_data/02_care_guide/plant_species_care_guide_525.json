          "description": "Bugbane requires regular watering to stay healthy and to promote growth. Water Bugbane deeply once every week or 2 when the soil is dry to the touch. In the summer, Bugbane may need a bit more frequent watering due to the hot weather. During the cooler months, Bugbane should have less frequent but deeper watering. Make sure to adjust accordingly based on the weather conditions and your local climate. Make sure to check the soil before watering as overwatering can be just as detrimental to Bugbane as underwatering."

          "description": "Bugbane (Actaea 'Pink Spire') thrives best in partial shade or partial sun. The ideal amount of sunshine for this plant species is 4 to 6 hours of sunlight a day. However, it should be noted that Bugbane can tolerate full shade or full sun for short periods of time. Therefore, if the plant has access to full sun, it should not be allowed to receive more than 6 hours of direct sunlight a day. "

          "description": "Bugbane (Actaea 'Pink Spire') should be pruned in late winter or early spring. This plant typically only requires light pruning consisting of removing dead, diseased, and damaged stems and removing any unwanted shoots that are growing in the wrong direction. It is important to be careful when pruning Bugbane as it is easily damaged by hard pruning. It is best to avoid pruning any more than 1/3 of the foliage as doing so can lead to decline in plant health."
