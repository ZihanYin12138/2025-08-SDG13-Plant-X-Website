          "description": "For watering boxwood (Buxus sempervirens 'Treska Gorge'), it is best to water thoroughly once or twice a week, depending on soil moisture levels and temperatures. In hot, dry weather, up to 3 or more waterings may be necessary. Make sure to water deeply so that the soil is evenly moist all the way through the root zone. If the soil is too wet, back off on the frequency and duration of each watering. Check soil moisture every few days and adjust your watering routine accordingly."

          "description": "Without adequate sunlight, boxwood (Buxus sempervirens ‘Treska Gorge’) will not thrive. To ensure healthy boxwood plants, it is essential to know how much and when sunlight is best for the species.\n\nFor optimal boxwood growth, the plants should receive full sun for at least 6-8 hours each day; long days of direct sunlight are important for proper growth and flowering.\n\nPartial shade is also acceptable provided the boxwood is always in partial shade during the hottest hours of the day when the sun’s rays are most intense. It is important to note that boxwood should be protected from the scorching afternoon sun and should not receive direct sunlight for more than 8 hours a day.\n\nAdditionally, boxwood prefers the cooler morning hours to be exposed to sunshine. It should not be placed in direct sun after 10:00 am and should receive some shade in the late afternoon.\n\nOverall, boxwood should receive 6-8 hours of sun per day, with cooler morning hours being the best for full sun exposure. To ensure your boxwood is thriving, monitor sunlight intake, and when possible, provide some degree of protection from the most intense rays of the day."

          "description": "Boxwood (Buxus sempervirens 'Treska Gorge') should be pruned in late winter or early spring. Pruning should be done minimal as Boxwood grows slowly and pruning can harm its health. Whenever pruning is necessary, prune only 1/3 of the foliage at a time. This will help ensure that the plant keeps throughout the season. Removal of any dead, diseased, or weakened branches should be the primary focus of pruning. Also, pruning Boxwood helps maintain a specific shape or size."
