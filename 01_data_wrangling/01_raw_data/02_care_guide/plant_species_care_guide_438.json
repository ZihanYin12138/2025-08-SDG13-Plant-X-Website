          "description": "Bear's Breeches should be watered deeply and infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out slightly between waterings. During the summer months, water your Bear's Breeches every 5–7 days (or more if the weather is particularly hot and dry). In cooler months, water every 7–10 days. Make sure to water thoroughly until the soil is damp (but not saturated) and water the soil at the base of the plant, avoiding wetting the foliage. During periods of hot and dry weather, it is advisable to increase the frequency of watering."

          "description": "Bear's breeches (Acanthus mollis 'Oak Leaf') will do best in full sunlight for at least 6 to 8 hours per day. In areas with strong sunlight, they should be located in locations that receive some afternoon shade. Bear's breeches can also do well in part shade, but when grown in these conditions, the plants won't be as vigorous or have as large of a flowering display as when grown in full sunlight."

          "description": "Bear's breeches (Acanthus mollis 'Oak Leaf') should be pruned in spring when the new growth starts to appear. Pruning should reduce the plant's height to about 1/3 of its original size. Additionally, hard pruning of flower stalks at soil level or close to it should be done after flowering has finished. This will keep the size of the plant manageable and allow for more bushier growth. Additionally, leave some of the old foliage and shoots - this will provide protection in winter and provide food resources for bees and other beneficial insects."
