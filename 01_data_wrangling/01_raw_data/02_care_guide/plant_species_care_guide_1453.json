          "description": "Carolina fanwort typically prefers warm water and can be grown easily in hard and alkaline conditions. It is best to water your Carolina fanwort twice a week, allowing the top inch of soil to dry out between waterings. Avoid over-watering as this can cause root rot. Provide about 1/2 inch of water each time you water your plant."

          "description": "Carolina fanwort (Cabomba caroliniana) benefits from full sun for most of the day, ideally at least 6 hours each day. It is best to avoid exposure to direct midday sunlight when temperatures are highest, as this can damage the plant. It will grow with less light, but degrades to an unattractive brown/yellow color and does not thrive as well."

          "description": "Prune the plant any time in early spring through mid-fall. Prune it back to 1 or 2 inches above the water line and remove all dead or yellowing leaves. In addition, prune up to 1/3 of the total growth to keep the plant healthy and promote bushiness. Doing regular, light pruning at least once a month is the best way to keep the Carolina fanwort looking neat and attractive."
