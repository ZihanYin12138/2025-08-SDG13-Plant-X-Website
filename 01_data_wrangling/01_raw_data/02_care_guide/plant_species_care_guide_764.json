          "description": "Juneberry plants need a moderate amount of water, particularly during the growing season. It is important to keep the soil moist, but not soggy. If plants are planted in areas with drier soils, water deeply (1-2 inches) once a week. If planted in areas with higher moisture soils, water 1-2 times a week, but only until the top of the soil begins to dry out. During hot, dry periods, more frequent watering may be necessary to keep the soil from drying out completely. Avoid over-watering as it can lead to root rot and other problems."

          "description": "Juneberry plants thrive in full sun to partial shade. When grown in full sun, they require at least 6 hours of sunlight every day for optimal growth. In shadier locations, they will do best with 4 to 6 hours of direct light. The best time for sunlight for your Juneberry is in the morning, when the sun is not at its hottest, and situating the plant in a spot that will receive sun during the morning hours should give it the best chance for a healthy growth."

          "description": "Juneberry (Amelanchier Lamarckii) should be pruned in early spring, before new growth appears. This plant benefits from pruning to produce beautiful, bushy growth and can be pruned to fit the desired shape or size of your garden space. Pruning should only be light. Remove any dead or damaged limbs or twigs by cutting them off at the base. Remove any crossing branches to prevent the formation of a web-like structure. Also, remove any branches that are growing downward to keep the plant upright. Remove any stems that are causing crowding and thinning the plant from within to create a well balanced plant overall. Finally, it is important to prune any suckers that are popping up around the base of the plant to stop it from becoming invasive."
