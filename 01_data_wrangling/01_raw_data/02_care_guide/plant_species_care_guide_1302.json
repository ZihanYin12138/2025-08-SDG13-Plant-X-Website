          "description": "Akee prefers a moist environment, so it is important to ensure that the soil remains consistently moist but not soggy. The soil should be watered regularly, approximately once a week in the summer months, and about every two weeks in the winter months. If the top layer of soil is dry to the touch, then watering is needed. Soak the soil until the water runs off and then allow any excess water to drain away. Avoid overwatering and remember to let the soil dry out somewhat between waterings. Akee plants may also need weekly misting to keep the leaves and flowers moist."

          "description": "As an indoor plant, it prefers bright, indirect light, with some direct sun for a few hours each day. Depending on the location and season, it should receive 3-4 hours of direct sunlight per day, preferably in the morning or late afternoon hours. When grown outside in zones 10 and 11, akee enjoys full sun, flourishing in temperatures from 65 to 85 degrees Fahrenheit. Avoid direct sun in the heat of the day and make sure to provide adequate shade during periods of intense, direct sunlight."

          "description": "The ideal timeframe for pruning the akee tree are the winter months, or after the fruiting season. Akee needs moderate pruning, and can be cut back 1/3 of its size in a single pruning session every two or three years. This lessens the need for regular pruning while maintaining the shape of the tree. For any neglected branches, they should be pruned to a single bud or branch junction to encourage new growth."
