          "description": "Water Japanese Maple trees at least once every week. Watering should be done in the morning or early evening when temperatures are mild, as hot temperatures can cause water droplets to magnify and burn the leaves. Check the soil before watering to see if it is dry, and if it has been, water generously; if the soil is still damp from the last watering, ease back on the amount of water used. When you do water, be sure to water the root zone of the tree and not just the leaves."

          "description": "Japanese Maple should be placed in a spot that receives 3-6 hours of direct sunlight per day, preferably in the morning for best results. Direct midday sun should be avoided as this could cause leaf scorch. Japanese Maples can also tolerate partial shade, but will not thrive if placed in a full shade location. If possible, the plant should be sheltered from strong winds, which can scorch the leaves, and it should be watered regularly throughout the growing season."

          "description": "Pruning Japanese Maples should take place in late winter to early spring when the trees are still dormant. Pruning should be light, removing no more than 1/3 of the total canopies of the maple trees. Pruning should focus on removing dead and crossing branches, thinning out dense areas, and cutting back long and unruly branches. This will allow light and air to penetrate the canopy, improve structural strength, and help prevent disease and pest infestations. Generally, no more than 5 branches should be removed in 1 season as it can cause undue stress for the tree if more than that is taken away."
