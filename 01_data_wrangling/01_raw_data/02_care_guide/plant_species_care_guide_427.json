When watering, make sure to water until the water runs out of the drainage holes of the pot. During hot summer days, you may need to water your flowering-maple a bit more often to keep the soil moist."

          "description": "Flowering-maple (Abutilon 'Moonchimes') prefers bright, indirect sunlight throughout the day. It thrives best in a location where it can receive no less than 4 to 6 hours of moderate to direct sunlight each day, ideally from morning until mid to late afternoon. Too much direct sunlight can burn the foliage, so if possible, try to find a location that receives shade from late afternoon until early morning. This will ensure that your flowering-maple is able to maintain its vibrant foliage and beautiful blooms throughout the year."

          "description": "Flowering-maple (Abutilon 'Moonchimes') should be pruned in late winter or early spring each year. Throughout the year, you should regularly prune any dead, diseased, or overgrown branches, as well as branches that lie too close together. This will keep the plant healthy and tidy. In late winter or early spring, you should prune the flowering maple more intensely to promote good air circulation, remove deadwood, and to control the size of the plant. Depending on the shape and size you are trying to achieve, you can lightly cut a few branches back by up to 1/3 or prune all of the branches back to the desired shape."
