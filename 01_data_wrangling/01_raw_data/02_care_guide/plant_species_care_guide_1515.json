          "description": "Water Californian allspice plants consistently during its first growing season. This ensures they become well established. Young plants need 1-2 inches of water each week during the warm months, preferably in the morning. In winter, reduce watering until spring, when temperatures rise and the plants actively grow. During hot, dry spells, water mature plants every 7-10 days, approximately 1-2 inches each time. If rainfall is good that season, supplement with only occasional water to prevent soggy soils. Californian allspice is relatively drought tolerant, so don't overdo it. On average, they will require about 2-3 summer waterings per month. Reduce watering in autumn and winter and stop altogether if heavy rainfall arrives."

          "description": "Californian allspice needs full sun, meaning at least 6 hours of direct sunlight each day. This plant should be planted in an area that gets the most sun possible throughout the day of spring, summer, and early fall. In the winter months, the plant should be given some shade to protect it from the harsher temperatures. It is best to place the plant west or south-facing windows that allow for an adequate amount of sunlight throughout the day."

          "description": "Californian allspice should be pruned minimally and only when necessary to keep its natural form and encourage dense growth. Pruning should be done in late winter to early spring, before new growth begins. If pruning is needed to reduce size, remove up to 1-third of the older branches. Avoid removing too much of the shoot as it can delay bloom by up to a few years. If needed, trim back any crowded or crossing branches to maintain the desired shape. Thin out any excess branches that are cluttering the shrub to promote airflow and sunlight penetration. Finally, remove any dead, decaying, or diseased branches to help maintain healthy plant growth."
