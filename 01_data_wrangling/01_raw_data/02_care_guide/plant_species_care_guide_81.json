          "description": "Moonfire Japanese Maple (Acer palmatum 'Moonfire') typically needs thorough watering once or twice a week, depending on the weather conditions. When irrigating the plant, check the soil at least 1 to 2 inches down, and if it feels dry, provide a deep, slow watering for about 15 minutes or until moist. If conditions are hot and dry, it may need to be watered more often and for a longer period. On the other hand, if conditions are cooler and/or wetter, skip a watering day or 2. "

          "description": "Moonfire Japanese Maple will need at least 4-5 hours of direct sunlight daily for optimal growth. If possible, they should be placed in an area that receives full sun during the morning hours and partial shade during the afternoon hours. This will help the plant to remain cooler and also produce its stunning foliage. The plant is particularly sensitive to the intensity of the sunlight and too much direct sun may cause scorched or yellowed foliage."

          "description": "Moonfire Japanese Maple (Acer palmatum 'Moonfire'), like most Japanese maples, should be pruned during the dormant season (late fall or early winter). The amount of pruning needed depends on the size and form of the Moonfire maple, but generally, light pruning is recommended. Prune out any branches that are damaged, rubbing, crossing, or dead, and thin out the canopy to reduce the density of foliage and open up the plant. Remove any suckers at the base of the trunk and thin out any overcrowding. Pruning should also be done to shape the tree or maintain the desired size and form. When pruning, make sure cuts are clean and angled slightly away from the center of the tree. All cuts should be done with pruning shears to minimize damage to the bark and wood."
