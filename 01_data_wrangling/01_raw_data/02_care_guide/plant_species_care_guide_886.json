During the warmer months, water thoroughly with a hose or watering can, making sure to saturate the soil about 6 inches deep. During cold periods when the plant has become dormant, water only lightly. During the winter, consider giving the soil a light misting once every 2 weeks. Do not let the plant sit in standing water. Make sure the soil drains well and does not become soggy."

          "description": "Columbine (Aquilegia 'Music Mix') needs plenty of sunlight to thrive. It needs at least 6â€“8 hours of direct sunlight every day. This type of plant is an ideal choice for various locations, such as borders, rock gardens, and planters. The best time to give your Columbine the ample amount of light it needs is during the day, when the sun is the strongest. Try to position the plant where it will be exposed to the sun's rays for the majority of the day. Make sure to avoid areas with too much shade as not enough light can affect the plants growth. Inconsistent light levels can also cause a reduction in the quantity and quality of the flower blooms."

          "description": "Columbine (Aquilegia 'Music Mix') should be pruned in late winter or early spring, before new growth begins. Start by removing any dead or damaged stems. Then, cut the stems back to just above ground level. This will encourage a new flush of foliage and blooms for the season. Pruning any spent blooms after they have finished flowering will help to discourage the plant from setting seed and help to keep it blooming longer. Finally, when the plant becomes too large or overcrowded, lightly prune the stems in late winter or early spring to control its size."
