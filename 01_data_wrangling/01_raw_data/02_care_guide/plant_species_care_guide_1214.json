          "description": "When watering a Rex Begonia, it is best to water lightly and often. The ideal frequency of watering should be every 4-7 days. In general, if the soil is moist, do not water. If it is dry, it may need to be watered. When watering, it is important to use lukewarm water, since Rex Begonias generally prefer warm conditions. Water the area around the roots until the water runs through the drainage holes. Over-watering can be harmful to the plant, so be sure not to water more than is necessary."

          "description": "Rex begonias do best when they receive bright, indirect light from a south or east-facing window. They should receive between 4 to 6 hours of sunlight each day, preferably with morning light and shade for the rest of the day during the hottest part of the day. Consider providing some shade during the day, as direct sun can damage the plant's foliage and cause leaf burn."

          "description": "Rex begonias are slow-growing, so they only need light pruning to keep the shape and size under control. Itâ€™s best to prune rex begonias in the spring, before they begin to grow new leaves. To prune, simply snip off any dead or damaged foliage or stems with a pair of sharp scissors. This should be done with each new year and will help the plant look healthier and full. If the plant is becoming overgrown, it can be lightly sheared down to keep it in a manageable size. "
