          "description": "Watering for a Golden Norway Spruce (Picea abies 'Aurea') plant should be done when the top 2-3 inches of its soil are dry. This should typically occur once per week, but may need to be done more or less frequently depending on the amount of sunlight and heat the plant receives. When watering, thoroughly water the entire root mass until water runs out the bottom of the pot, and then allow the pot to drain completely. Additionally, never allow the Norway Spruce's soil to dry out completely, as this can damage the plant."

Pruning should not be severe and should focus on removing dead, diseased or damaged branches as well as crossing or rubbing branches. Pruning should be limited to no more than 1-third of the tree's total foliage and should not be done in a manner that removes the natural shape and overall form of the tree."
