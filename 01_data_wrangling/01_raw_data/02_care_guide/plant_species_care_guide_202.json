Water thoroughly until there is runoff coming from the bottom of the pot. Allow the soil to dry out between waterings and maintain moist soil after each watering. During the summer, increase watering to twice a week if the weather is particularly hot or dry."

This will help the tree maintain its vibrant yellow foliage color throughout the year. The amount of sunlight received should peak during early morning and late afternoon. Partial shade is also okay, but the tree's foliage will more likely retain its yellow tones in full sun. "

          "description": "Golden Deodar Cedar (Cedrus deodara 'Aurea') should be pruned in late winter or early spring before new growth appears. You can prune up to about a third of the tree, depending on how large it is, as it can grow to be about 60 feet tall. Do not prune if you want the tree to form a natural-looking shape. When pruning, always remove dead, weak, or diseased branches first. If only 1-third of the tree is being removed, try to prune from all sides in order to maintain the tree’s shape. Thinning is also recommended to allow better air circulation and light penetration, as well as to improve the tree’s overall appearance. Be sure to make your cuts clean and close to the trunk to prevent damage to the tree."
