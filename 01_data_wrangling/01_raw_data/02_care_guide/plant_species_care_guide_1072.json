          "description": "Chinese astilbes prefer moist soil and need to be kept consistently hydrated to thrive. During the growing season, water Chinese astilbes 1 to 2 times per week, providing about 1 to 2 inches of water each time. Water in the morning and avoid getting the foliage wet. During the winter, water only when the soil has become dry. In very hot, dry climates, check the soil more frequently and make sure to provide enough water so that the soil stays moist."

          "description": "Chinese astilbe performs best in partial shade with 4-6 hours of direct sunlight per day. This could be at any time of the day, as long as the plant is not exposed to direct sunlight for more than 6 hours of the day. Direct sunlight for more than 6 hours a day can cause the leaves of the plant to wilt and dry up, leading to plant damage or death."

          "description": "Chinese astilbe should be pruned in late fall/early winter after it has gone dormant. Pruning should be a light trimming, taking off about 1/3 of the plant, mainly the foliage and spent blooms. If the Chinese astilbe is overgrown, it can be cut back hard to 1/2 its size to encourage fresh growth the following season."
