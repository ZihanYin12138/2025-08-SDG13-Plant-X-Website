          "description": "Columbine (Aquilegia vulgaris var. flore-pleno 'Blue Bonnet') do best in moist, well-drained soil, but do not allow the soil to become soggy. During the growing season these plants should be watered regularly and allow the soil to get a chance to dry out between waterings. Depending on the temperature they will need to watered once to twice a week, however in hotter weather they will require more frequent watering. Keeping the soil moist is key for this plant during growing season and avoid excessively dry soil. During the winter months, it's important to keep the soil moist, while avoiding over-watering."

          "description": "Columbine (Aquilegia vulgaris var. flore-pleno ‘Blue Bonnet’) enjoys partial to full sun and prefers 4-6 hours of direct sunlight per day. Direct sunlight is preferred for a few hours in the morning and the rest of the day should be lightly shaded. Keeping them in full sun during the hottest parts of the day may cause scorching of the leaves or possibly death of the plant. Thus, it is best to keep them in an area with morning sun and afternoon shade."

          "description": "Columbine should be pruned in the summer, after the plant has finished flowering and starting to go dormant. Light pruning is best – no more than a 1/3 of a stem should be removed at a time. This will help to improve the overall structure and shape of the plant as well as encourage more flowers. Pruning can also help to reduce disease and pest pressure. It is important to avoid cutting back the crown of the plant as this could damage the roots and also weaken the stem. Prune out any dead or diseased branches and stems, and to keep a compact shape prune back side shoots to 3-5 leaves."
