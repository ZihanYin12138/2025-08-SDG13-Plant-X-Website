The soil should be kept evenly moist but never soggy. When watering, water thoroughly, until it drains from the bottom of the pot, and then discard any excess water from the saucer."

          "description": "Wild ginger (Asarum shuttleworthii) thrive in bright, indirect sunlight. An eastern or a northern-facing window is best for it because direct light through a window may dry out the soil too much. During the summer months, give it 3 to 4 hours of bright sunlight each day, and during winter months, let it receive 2 to 3 hours of daylight. However, avoid direct sunlight as it can damage the plant."

          "description": "Wild ginger should be pruned once a year, during the late winter or early spring, when the plant is dormant. Since wild ginger tends to grow slowly, it will not require an extensive pruning. Generally, it is recommended to remove up to a third of the oldest and tallest stems, trimming the shoots down just above the soil to prevent regrowth. It is also beneficial to trim away dead stems at any time throughout the year. Additionally, pruning any overhanging branches will help encourage new growth and promote a denser, bushier look."
