          "description": "The Dutchman's pipe (Aristolochia tomentosa) should be watered regularly but the amount may vary depending on the climate and soil conditions. During periods of drought, you may need to water your Dutchman's pipe more often. During cooler months, the plant should only need watering every 2-4 weeks. Be sure to water thoroughly, so all the soil is saturated. Stop watering when you notice the top 3 inches (7.5 cm) of soil is dry. The plant also prefers more water during the summer months. In addition, it's best to provide the plant with plenty of moisture during the growing season. If you're unsure when to water your Dutchman's pipe, feel the soil and water when it is dry."

          "description": "Dutchman's pipe (Aristolochia tomentosa) thrive best in locations with full to partial sunlight. They require 8-10 hours of direct sun exposure, preferably morning sunlight. Resting in direct sun for prolonged periods in the afternoon, however, can cause some burning, so try to avoid such direct sunlight for long periods of time. Dutchman's pipe also benefits from some light shade in the hottest periods, such as afternoon hours on hot summer days."

          "description": "For Dutchman's pipe, pruning should be done once or twice a year. Pruning should be done in late winter/early spring or mid-summer, and should shape the plant and remove dead wood or water-stressing shoots. Cut back trailing stems to maintain an attractive shape. Pruning is also important for quality flower production. Remove spent flower stems immediately after flowering to increase the amount of blooms the next season. As Dutchman's pipe is a fast-growing species, light pruning can help keep the plant from becoming overgrown."
