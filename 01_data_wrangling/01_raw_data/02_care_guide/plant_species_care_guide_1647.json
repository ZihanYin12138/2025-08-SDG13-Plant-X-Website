          "description": "Japanese grass sedge should be watered regularly throughout the year. During active growth in spring and summer, water Carex morrowii 'Goldband' about once a week. Be sure to keep the top 2-3 inches of soil consistently moist. During periods of drought or hot weather, the plant may need to be watered more frequently. In winter, watering should be reduced to once every 2 weeks. Make sure that the soil in which the grass sedge is planted does not dry out completely between waterings."

          "description": "Japanese grass sedge (Carex morrowii 'Goldband') requires full sun to partial shade, meaning that it needs at least 4 to 6 hours of direct sunlight per day. It should receive the majority of its light during the morning hours when the sun is lower and the light rays are more gentle. During the summer months when the sun is higher and harsher, part shade in the afternoon is recommended."

          "description": "Pruning is a key component in keeping Japanese Grass Sedge (Carex morrowii 'Goldband') healthy and looking its best. To maintain the plantâ€™s attractive shape, it is important to prune it annually in late winter or early spring, before new growth starts to emerge. In order to preserve the attractive variegated foliage, remove any faded or brown leaves. A light shearing of the foliage is recommended every year to encourage a fuller look. You can also trim the plant to create a more formal shape, or prune as needed for size control. As with most plants, avoid pruning too much at once as this can shock the plant and cause it to become less vigorous."
