          "description": "Grassy-leaved sweet flag (Acorus gramineus 'Oborozuki') is a water loving plant that prefers to have moist soil at all times. It is best to water this plant deeply and infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out in between. During the spring and summer, it should be watered once a week, ensuring that the top several inches of soil are moist. During the fall and winter, it is best to water only once every 2 to 3 weeks.  Be sure to avoid over-watering as this can lead to root rot."

This plant does not need full sun to thrive, as it prefers more indirect sunlight. However, the plant may benefit from some sun in the morning to encourage growth. Morning sun for up to 4 hours each day is recommended for this species. "

          "description": "Grassy-leaved sweet flag (Acorus gramineus 'Oborozuki') should be pruned in late winter or early spring. Prune the plant back to 1/3 its size by first removing any dead or damaged branches. Once all damaged branches have been removed, use pruning shears to cut back remaining branches to 1/3 or less of their current size. Be sure to make clean cuts and to not leave any jagged edges on the remaining stems. Doing so can promote healthy new growth that will thrive throughout the growing season."
