          "description": "Siberian bugloss (Brunnera macrophylla 'Hadspen Cream') needs to be kept moist. Water the plant deeply once or twice a week with lukewarm water, when the top inch or 2 of soil feels dry. Make sure not to overwater, as the plants may suffer root rot. During the spring and summer months, you may need to water more frequently. During the winter, reduce the watering to once every 2 weeks; plants go dormant in the winter and require less water. If the pot is small enough, you can dip the pot into a larger container of water until bubbles form and then quickly remove the pot. This will ensure that the entire root system becomes moist."

          "description": "Siberian bugloss (Brunnera macrophylla 'Hadspen Cream') requires a moderate amount of full sunlight for optimum growth. Generally, it should receive 4 to 6 hours of direct or dappled sunlight a day. Depending on the season, the lengthy of time it spends in the sun can change. During spring and summer months, it should receive slightly more sunlight for ideal growth, while in fall and winter, the plant requires slightly less exposure to direct sunlight. If the plant receives too much intense sunlight, the leaves may become scorched or dried out. Furthermore, if it does not receive enough sunlight, the leaves may yellow or become limp."

          "description": "Siberian bugloss (Brunnera macrophylla 'Hadspen Cream') should be lightly pruned in the early spring when new growth appears. This will help encourage vigorous, bushy growth and prevent the plant from becoming leggy. Remove any dead or diseased stems, as well as any that are thin, weak, or overlapping. Trim the remaining stems by no more than 1/3 of their current size. This will help maintain the shape of the shrub without damaging its health. After pruning, mulch the soil around the plant well to protect it from temperature fluctuations."
