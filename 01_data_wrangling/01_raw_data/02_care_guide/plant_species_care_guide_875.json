          "description": "Columbine (Aquilegia chrysantha 'Yellow Queen) is a medium-sized, perennial plant that requires regular watering. The plant should be watered deeply every 7 to 10 days during the growing season. During extended periods of hot, dry weather, water more frequently. Allow the plant to dry out between waterings, but avoid letting the soil become too dry. This species is particularly sensitive to soggy soil. Itâ€™s best to check the soil moisture about 2 inches (5 cm) below the surface before watering."

          "description": "Columbine (Aquilegia chrysantha 'Yellow Queen') grows best in full sun to partial shade. This plant does well when it receives at least 6 hours of direct sunlight each day with morning sun being ideal. This will help to ensure it blooms all season long. For optimal flowering, columbine should receive full sun all day, but it will tolerate some afternoon shade. The amount of sunlight this plant tolerates will vary depending on the climate, so it's important to check the plant's cultivar and location before deciding which amount of sun is best."

          "description": "Columbine (Aquilegia chrysantha 'Yellow Queen') should be pruned lightly after the first season of flowering. Prune back the stems to 1/3 of their original length to bring the plant into a more compact (bushy) shape, removing any dead stems. Pruning can be done in late winter until the plants finish flowering. Light deadheading (removal of spent flowers) throughout the season is also beneficial for promoting a tidier habit and additional blooms. Heavy pruning should be avoided and done sparingly."
