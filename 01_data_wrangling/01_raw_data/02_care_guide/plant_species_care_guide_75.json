          "description": "The Koshibori Nishiki Japanese Maple (Acer palmatum 'Koshibori Nishiki') requires regular watering to help it flourish. It will generally need 1 inch of water each week during the growing season. In the early spring and late fall, water every few weeks during dry conditions. The best way to water is to soak the soil deeply, so that the water reaches the roots. During periods of extreme heat, more frequent watering may be necessary. In the winter, there is no need to water this plant as it is dormant."

          "description": "Koshibori Nishiki Japanese Maple (Acer palmatum 'Koshibori Nishiki') thrives best in full sun or partial shade. This species is highly tolerant of full sun exposure, but enough shade should be provided in warm climates to prevent scorching of its foliage. Sunlight should be limited to 5 to 6 hours per day in hot climates, with partial shade during the hottest part of the day. In areas with mild climates, full direct sunlight is recommended. Providing adequate sunlight helps keep the plants vibrant and healthy."

          "description": "Pruning is an important part of caring for your Koshibori Nishiki Japanese Maple and can help control its size and shape. Pruning should be done each year, preferably in late winter. Start by removing any dead or damaged branches, as well as any crossed or rubbing branches. Next, remove any branches that are growing closer to the ground than you'd like. Pruning should be done to maintain the desired size and shape of the tree and should never exceed 1/3 of the total branches. When pruning, make sure to use sharp pruning tools and prune just outside the branch collar to minimize the risk of disease. Always clean your tools between cuts to avoid spreading any disease from 1 branch to another."
