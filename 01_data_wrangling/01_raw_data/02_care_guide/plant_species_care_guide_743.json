          "description": "Lily of the Incas (Alstroemeria 'Sweet Laura') should be watered deeply and slowly to allow ample time for the soil to absorb the water. Water once every 1-2 weeks, or when the top 1 to 2 inches of soil are dry, ensuring the soil is evenly moist. Avoid overwatering, which can lead to root rot, by allowing the plant to almost dry out in between waterings."

          "description": "Lily of the Incas (Alstroemeria 'Sweet Laura') needs bright, indirect sunlight for optimal growth. This means that the plant should be positioned near a sunny window, but indirect light should filter through a sheer curtain or similar material to avoid spotting or burning of the leaves. The plant should receive at least 6 hours of sunlight per day, and up to 8 hours during the growing season. If the lily of the Incas is positioned where it receives too much direct sunlight, it may start to wilt and show signs of distress."

Dead and/or damaged branches should be removed first. Then selectively prune out any weaker stems that don't match the desired shape."
