Water deeply every 1-3 days during the growing season, and less often during cold months. Plants should never be allowed to sit in soggy soil as this will cause root rot. To check if the plant needs water, wait until the top 1-2 inches of soil is dry before watering. Make sure to water near the base of the plant and not directly onto the leaves."

Ideally, the plant should receive between 8-10 hours of direct sunlight, in order to encourage the best yield of fruit. Soursop plants should also receive the majority of its light during the morning hours. If the soursop plant is unable to receive this amount of sunlight, additional plant lights can be used to supplement its light intake."

          "description": "When it comes to pruning soursop (Annona muricata) it is best to be patient and very light-handed in order to ensure healthy growth. This plant benefits from minimal pruning; only cutting away dead or diseased branches. If a branch is crossing with another or growing in an awkward direction it can be trimmed off at the joint where it connects to the main stem. Large branches can be pruned back no more than 1/3 of their length and during the warmer months of spring or summer. During this time, wait for after any flowering and fruiting to complete to reduce any shock to the plant and encourage healthy regrowth."
