          "description": "Water deeply when the soil is dry to a depth of about 1 inch, and reduce watering in the winter months when the plant is dormant. Generally, an adult Aloe ferox should be watered about once a week in the summer months and less in the winter, about every other week or so. Do not overwater, as this can cause root rot. Be sure to check the soil before watering. If the soil is still moist from the last watering, hold off until it has slightly dried out."

          "description": "Cape aloe (Aloe ferox) should be pruned in late spring as new growth begins to appear just prior to the summer months. Pruning should be more moderate and limited to removing dead or damaged leaves and any dead flower stalks. It is important to not prune more than 1/3 of the leaves at once. Too much pruning can weaken the plant and reduce its growth rate."
