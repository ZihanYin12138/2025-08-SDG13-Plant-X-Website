          "description": "Red maple (Acer rubrum 'October Glory') requires moderately moist soil, so it should be watered once a week when the top inch of soil is dry. Make sure to deeply soak the soil until water runs out of the drainage holes when you water. During the summer months, when temperatures are hot and dry, you may need to water twice a week. In the winter months, you can reduce watering to once every 2 weeks. Avoid overwatering as it can cause root rot and other problems. Avoid watering in the evening so that the leaves dry before cooler nighttime temperatures set in."

          "description": "Red Maple (Acer rubrum 'October Glory') is a deciduous tree that prefers full sunlight in order to thrive. It requires 6-8 hours of direct sunlight per day in order for its leaves to reach their fullest potential of a stunning red and gold color in autumn. During the warmer months of July and August, it is best to place it in an area with some partial shade during the hottest times of the day in order to protect it from intense heat."

          "description": "Red Maple (Acer rubrum 'October Glory') generally requires minimal pruning. Pruning is best done shortly after blooming, which typically occurs in late spring or early summer. Trimming off any dead, weak, or diseased branches helps the tree stay healthy and thrive. You can also prune the tree to maintain an aesthetically pleasing shape or to remove any crossing or rubbing branches. It is important not to over-prune Red Maple trees as this can lead to stress and/or disease. If pruning is needed, try to take no more than 1/3 of the tree's overall foliage."
