          "description": "Water the Inca lily plants about once a week to keep the soil evenly moist. There should be no standing water in the tray or pot. During the active growth period, between spring and autumn, a single deep watering should suffice. During the winter the plants need less water and can generally survive with just 1 or 2 shallow waterings a month. Always check the soil before watering; if it is still moist then wait another few days before watering again."

          "description": "The Inca lily requires full sunlight for optimal growth and flowering. Ideally, it should receive 6 to 8 hours of direct sunlight each day, although it can tolerate partial shade. For best results, the Inca lily should receive morning sunlight and some afternoon shade. This will help to prevent the leaves from turning yellow or becoming sunburnt. When planted in a warm, sunny location, it will produce a profusion of flowers throughout the summer months."

          "description": "Inca lilies should be pruned annually in early spring. Remove any dead or damaged foliage, stems, buds, and seedpods. Cut stems back to just above the basal foliage, leaving 2 to 3 leaves per stem. Pruning and deadheading will improve the growth and bloom of the Inca lilies and keep them healthy. Prune lightly no more than 1/3 of the plant at a time to preserve the full bloomage season."
