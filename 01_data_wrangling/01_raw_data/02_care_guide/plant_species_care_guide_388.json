          "description": "Dawn Redwood should be watered regularly, approximately once every 7-10 days. Check the soil of the Dawn Redwood before watering, and water only when the top 2-3 inches (5-7 cm) of the soil are dry. When watering the tree, use a gentle and consistent stream of water. Allow the water to slowly soak in to the soil, rather than wetting the leaves. It is recommended to water near the base of the tree trunk enabling the soil to be evenly moist to support the treeâ€™s growth."

          "description": "Dawn Redwood (Metasequoia glyptostroboides) is a species native to central China that prefers full sunlight in order to thrive and grow. This species should be planted in an area that receives direct sunlight for at least 6 to 8 hours per day depending on the season. During the summer months, when days are longer, Dawn Redwoods will benefit from a full 8 hours of direct sunlight daily. During the winter, however, the shorter days mean that 6 hours of direct sunlight will still be beneficial for the health of the tree."

          "description": "When it comes to pruning Dawn Redwood (Metasequoia glyptostroboides) plants, it is best to do so during late winter and early spring. During this time, give the tree a light pruning to remove any dead, diseased, or damaged branches. This can help to ensure the tree stays healthy and maintains a full canopy. Avoid pruning more than 1/3 of the canopy each year and strive to maintain an overall balanced look. Also, prune any branches that are rubbing or are crossing each other, as this can cause damage. It is also important to avoid pruning away too much of the inner branches, as it reduces foliage and can disturb the look of the tree."
