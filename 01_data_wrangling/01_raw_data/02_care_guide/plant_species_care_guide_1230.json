          "description": "Holly-leaved barberry (Berberis aquifolium) should be watered once a week in warm weather, and once every 2 weeks in cold weather. To water it, make sure to use lukewarm water and soak the roots thoroughly until it reaches a depth of about 12 inches. Do not water the leaves as this can damage them and cause mold to grow. Also, make sure to wait until the soil is dry to the touch in between waterings, as overwatering can lead to root rot. Most importantly, take care not to forget to water your plant as this can cause it to become weak and unhealthy."

          "description": "Holly-leaved barberry (Berberis aquifolium) can be grown in full sun to part shade. It does best when given several hours of direct sunlight throughout the day. This plant enjoys the sun's warmth and can tolerate up to 6-8 hours of full sun each day. In areas with very hot climates, it is best to give the plant some afternoon shade. If the plant is located in too much shade, you may find that the new foliage is not as abundant and may become overly sparse. When located in the right amount of sunlight, new growth comes in healthy and abundant."

          "description": "Holly-leaved barberry (Berberis aquifolium) should be pruned once in the early spring when the buds are starting to swell. Pruning should be done judiciously to maintain the natural shape of the plant, removing any shoots that cross, rub or are diseased. Old, dying leaves can be trimmed away and any new growth that threatens to congest the plant can be removed. Pruning should be done lightly, as Holl-leaved barberry responds well to a minimal amount of pruning. Keep in mind that pruning too much may compromise the health of the plant."
