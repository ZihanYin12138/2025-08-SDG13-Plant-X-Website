          "description": "Golden Full Moon Maple should be watered regularly and thoroughly. During the growing months (spring through fall), water them deeply once a week as long as the soil is kept consistently moist. Aim for 1-2 inches (2.5-5 cm) of water per application. During the winter, water them no more than once a month, but ensure the soil does not dry out completely. Be careful not to overwater the plant, as too much water can cause root rot."

Avoid placing them in an area that receives direct afternoon sunlight, as this can damage the leaves. An ideal spot is a location that is sheltered and receives the morning sun. "

          "description": "For Golden Full Moon Maple (Acer shirasawanum 'Aureum'), pruning should be done in late winter or early spring before buds swells and new growth begins. Prune before spring season begins or after. For larger trees, pruning can be done progressively over several years to avoid large cuts that cause excessive sap loss and heal slowly. Begin with pruning dead, dying, and diseased branches. Additionally, remove any crossing branches that are competing for resources and thinning out foliage to improve air and light penetration. It is beneficial to major pruning every 2 to 5 years to shape and control the tree's size. Heavy pruning is not recommended. Usually, no more than 25% of the live crown should be removed. This encourages bud development within the crown and maintains its overall structure."
