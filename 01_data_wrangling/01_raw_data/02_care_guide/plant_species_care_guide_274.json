          "description": "Common Persimmon plants require 1-2 inches of water per week when the top 2 inches of soil is dry. For best growth, water the entire root zone, not just the base of the plant. Drip irrigation is the best way to apply water to your Persimmon. The soil should be allowed to dry out slightly between each watering. Established Persimmon trees generally need less water as time progresses."

If it receives less than 6 hours of sunlight per day, it may become thin and spindly. If placed in heavy shade, the plants will produce fewer flowers and fruits. If you can provide 6 to 8 hours of direct sunlight per day, your Common Persimmon should thrive."

          "description": "Pruning of Diospyros virginiana (common persimmon) should be done in late winter prior to bud break. This can be done with either hand pruners or a pruning saw. Pruning should be done minimally and judiciously, as removing too much material without proper timing can result in reduced fruit. Generally, removing dead, diseased, and damaged wood before the growth season is a good place to start. Thin out some of the dense interior growth to allow for better air circulation."
