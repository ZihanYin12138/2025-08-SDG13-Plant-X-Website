During hot months and the soil moisture is low, increase the water amount and water more often. Add water until it begins to come out the drainage holes located at the bottom of the pot. During winter months, reduce the amount and frequency of watering, watering only when the soil appears dry."

          "description": "Sneezewort plants do best in full to partial sun. They need at least 6 hours of sun per day in order to flower and produce the desired colorful blooming stalks. Depending on the season, different amounts of sun might be necessary. In the spring and summer, when temperatures are warmer, 8â€“10 hours of sunlight per day allows them to achieve their most prolific blooming. In the cooler months of autumn and winter, as little as 6 hours of sun will usually suffice for their needs."

          "description": "Sneezewort (Achillea ptarmica (The Pearl Group)) can benefit from pruning in early spring or late winter, just prior to the start of new growth. Pruning should only be done when the plant is dormant and all of the flower heads have finished blooming. To maintain a bushy, compact shape, lightly trim back the plant by up to 1/3 of its overall height just before new growth begins in the spring.old flower heads should also be removed on a regular basis to prevent the plant from self-seeding and prevent it from becoming leggy."
