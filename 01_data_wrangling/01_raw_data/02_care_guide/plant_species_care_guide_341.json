          "description": "Watering for the D.D. Blanchard Magnolia should be done weekly and deeply. The soil should be kept moist, but not saturated. The best way to determine if the plant needs water is to press a finger in the soil - if it feels moist more than 1-2 inches down, no additional watering is needed. If the soil feels dry, then this is a sign that the magnolia needs to be watered. During hot, dry seasons, the magnolia may need to be watered every 3-4 days to keep the soil consistently moist."

          "description": "D.D. Blanchard Magnolia needs full sun for at least 6 to 8 hours per day. It fares best in an area that receives bright, indirect sunlight throughout the day, and protection from harsh winds. The plant also enjoys some shade during hot midday periods, preferably between the hours of 11 am to 3 pm. During these midday hours, it should preferably receive some gentle shade from trees or buildings, as the direct sun can be too much."

          "description": "Pruning D.D. Blanchard Magnolia (Magnolia grandiflora 'D.D. Blanchard') is best done at the beginning of the growing season, in early spring. This will allow new shoots to grow continuously throughout the year. Pruning should be done lightly, removing only dead or diseased branches. Minor shaping can also be done during the growing season if desired. Do not remove more than 1-third of the total branches in a single pruning session. It is important to not prune too close to the main stems of the tree, as this can make the tree prone to disease and infection."
