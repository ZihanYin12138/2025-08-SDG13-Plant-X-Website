          "description": "Bush violets should be watered regularly, about twice a week, making sure the soil is moist but not soggy. During the hottest months of summer, the plants should be watered more often - every 3 to 4 days. In extreme heat, provide more frequent watering, such as once a day or even multiple times a day as needed. During the cooler months, cut back on watering to once a week or less. Allow the soil to dry out in between waterings. Bush violets need more water during the flowering stage."

          "description": "Bush violet (Browallia speciosa) is best grown in partial-sun environments, so it should receive 4-6 hours of direct sunlight per day. During the hot summer months, it is recommended to place the plants in a position that receives morning sun and filtered afternoon sun, rather than prolonged direct sunlight. During the cooler months of the year, plants should receive a bit more direct sunlight."

          "description": "Bush violets should be pruned annually in late winter or early spring. Pruning should include trimming back lanky stems, deadheading spent flowers, and cutting away any dead or damaged foliage.\n\nIt is best to prune bush violets moderately, removing no more than 1-third of the total plant material, and keeping the overall shape and structure of the plant intact. If desired, stems can be pinched regularly to encourage a denser, more full bush."
