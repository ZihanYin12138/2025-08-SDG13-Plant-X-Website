          "description": "Brandt's Dwarf Japanese Maple should be watered regularly to maintain its health and promote growth. For indoor plants, check the soil for moisture daily to ensure that it does not dry out. Water when the top 1 to 2 inches of soil feels dry. For outdoor plants, water when the top 2-3 inches of soil feels dry. Generally, Brandt's Dwarf Japanese Maple should receive approximately 1 inch of water each week. During hot summer days, the plant may need more frequent watering to keep the soil moist. If rainfall is lacking, water deeply about once per week to ensure the root system receives adequate moisture."

          "description": "Brandt's Dwarf Japanese Maple does best when planted in an area that receives full to partial sun 6 hours or more each day. The plant will also do well in areas with indirect light, especially with morning or late afternoon sun. Planting in full shade can result in reduced leaf size or overall weak growth. For this particular species, a sunny afternoon is best with the sunlight being at least 4 hours in length. Direct sunlight should be limited in order to reduce the likelihood of leaf scorching and dehydration."

          "description": "Brandt's Dwarf Japanese Maple is a slow-growing tree and should be pruned lightly in early spring. Pruning should focus on branches that are creating imbalance or blocking light from other branches. Pruning should be done with sharp pruning shears, removing small amounts of the foliage at a time. This will help the tree to retain its natural shape and size. Avoid over-pruning, as this could cause irreversible damage to the tree. If you need to prune more than 1/4 of the plant, cut into smaller sections."
