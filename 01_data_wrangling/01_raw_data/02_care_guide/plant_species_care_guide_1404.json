          "description": "The boxwood species (Buxus 'Cranberry Creek') should be watered every 7 to 10 days. Water until the soil is saturated and then allow it to dry out before the next watering. During the warmer months, when more frequent watering is needed, water thoroughly 1-2 times per week. During the cooler months, water less frequently in order to encourage dormancy. It is important to check soil moisture levels before watering. If the soil feels dry to the touch 1 inch below the surface, it is time to water."

          "description": "Boxwood (Buxus 'Cranberry Creek') grows best in bright, indirect sunlight. It prefers about 4 to 6 hours of direct sun each day, and it can tolerate shadier spots with indirect sunlight for the remainder of the day. It is important to avoid too much direct sunlight, as this can burn the leaves, and the plant can struggle to grow in too much shade. Aim for consistent light, and avoid full direct afternoon sun, especially in areas with hot summers."

          "description": "The best time to prune Boxwood (Buxus 'Cranberry Creek') is in late winter or early spring before new growth begins. However, it can also be pruned at any time of the year if there is a need for shaping or size control. Take care not to prune too much of the foliage or cut branches too close to the trunk, as this can damage the plant.\n\nWhen it comes to pruning, less is more with Boxwood (Buxo 'Cranberry Creek'). Generally, only 1/3 of the plant should be pruned away each year and more drastic pruning should only be done as needed. Pruning should be done gradually over the span of several years so that the plant does not go into shock and to prevent dieback. It is also important to be sure that the tools used are sharp and clean to avoid any damage or spread of disease."
