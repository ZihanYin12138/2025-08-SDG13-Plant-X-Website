          "description": "Spindle Tree (Euonymus europaeus) prefers an even and consistent amount of moisture, so regular watering is advised. For container-grown plants, keeping the soil evenly moist is best. Water as needed, at least once per week during hot and dry periods. Monitor the soil to ensure it does not become too dry or soggy.\n\nIf you are in a particularly dry or hot climate, it may be necessary to increase the amount of water you give your spindle tree, up to every other day. During the spring and summer months, water new growth and landscape trees to a depth of several feet. This will encourage strong root growth and keep foliage from wilting.\n\nIn cooler or wetter climates, you may need to water the plants less often. During the winter months, water only when the soil is dry for several inches. This helps allow the tree to go into a natural dormancy period.\n"

          "description": "Spindle Tree (Euonymus europaeus) requires full sun to partial shade. The species should receive at least 6 hours of direct sunlight each day. When placed in areas with full sun, the tree will reach its full potential. Placement in partial shade will promote a more sprawling, dense growth habit. During summer, try to provide afternoon shade to protect the tree from too much direct sunlight."

          "description": "Pruning is an important part of maintaining a healthy Spindle Tree. Pruning should be done in late winter or early spring before bud break. This will ensure the tree is dormant ensuring less stress during pruning. Remove dead, broken, or diseased branches anytime during the year. To maintain a healthy shape, prune out any suckers coming from the base of the tree or any branches growing in toward the center of the tree. You can also selectively prune to thin out the canopy and remove overly vigorous branches to encourage better air circulation and reduce any competing branches. Thinning the canopy has been known to reduce the risk of aphid infestations. Pruning should be done carefully by removing no more than 25% of the canopy in a single season."
