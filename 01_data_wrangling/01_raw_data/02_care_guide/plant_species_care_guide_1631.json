This should be done until the soil is fully saturated. Try to water the plant early in the morning or late in the evening to avoid excessive evaporation. Be sure not to over-water, as this can cause root rot."

This type of sedge prefers to receive at least 6 hours of direct sunlight each day. It is best to provide these plants with at least 4 hours of direct sunlight in the morning, followed by some indirect light in the afternoon, or the entire day in full sun."

          "description": "Although Carex dolichostachya 'Kaga-nishiki' GOLD FOUNTAINS are low-maintenance plants, they still benefit from occasional pruning. Pruning keeps the plant looking tidy, and it encourages new growth, which helps to create a full, lush look. Pruning should be done in early spring or late fall. If you prune in early spring, you should wait until the new growth appears before pruning. If you prune in late fall, wait until late winter or early spring."
