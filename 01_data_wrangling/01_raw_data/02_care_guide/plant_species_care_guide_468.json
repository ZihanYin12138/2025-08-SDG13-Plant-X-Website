          "description": "Watering for a sugar maple (Acer saccharum 'Sweet Shadow') should be done twice weekly during the growing season. You should water the tree deeply, allowing the water to penetrate down to the roots. The volume of water will depend on the size of your tree and the climate where it's growing, but 1 to 2 gallons for every 3 feet of tree height is a good rule of thumb. Water your sugar maple in the early morning to reduce water loss to evaporation."

          "description": "Sugar maple trees require full sun for best growth and development. They can tolerate some shade but produce best results when they receive at least 6 to 8 hours of direct sunlight per day. During the spring and summer months, when the days are longer, make sure that the tree is exposed to the sun for a minimum of 6 to 8 hours per day. During the winter months, when days are typically shorter, the tree may not get the minimum required amount of sunlight. If this is the case, supplemental lighting may be necessary to help ensure optimal growth and development."

          "description": "Sugar maple trees should be pruned in late winter or early spring before buds begin to swell. Pruning should be done sparingly and only when necessary, such as when the tree has crossed or interfering branches, or if it is becoming too large for its space. Remove no more than 15% of the total crown (foliage) of the tree in any given year to avoid stressing the tree too much. If any dead, diseased, or broken branches are present, they should be removed completely."
