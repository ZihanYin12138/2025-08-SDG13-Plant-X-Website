          "description": "Hummingbird's mint should be watered moderately, depending on the season. In the spring and summer months, this species prefers about an inch of water per week. To avoid waterlogging the soil, this is best distributed over several waterings during this period. In autumn, water should be reduced to about every 2 weeks, and in the winter months, it should only be watered when the top few inches of soil appear dry to the touch. Too much water during the winter can lead to root rot."

          "description": "Hummingbird's mint (Agastache cana) prefers full sun to part shade. It is best planted in an area that gets 6 or more hours of direct sunlight each day, ideally from mid-morning to late afternoon. If planted in an area with less than 6 hours of direct sunlight, the plant may become spindly or stop blooming. It can also handle some shade, especially in hotter climates."

          "description": "Hummingbird's Mint (Agastache cana) should be pruned in the late winter or early spring just before the new growth appears. Pruning should be light, removing only the dead growth and operating stems of the plant. Prune back excess stems to create a balanced shape and reduce the overall size if desired. This variety of mint is drought resistant but will respond to regular pruning and waterings; this will improve the quality and density of the plantâ€™s flowers. Deadheading (removing the old blooms) will encourage new growth and more flowers in the summertime."
