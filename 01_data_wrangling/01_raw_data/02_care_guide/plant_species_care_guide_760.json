          "description": "Serviceberry (Amelanchier canadensis 'Glenn Form' RAINBOW PILLAR) should be watered upon planting, then 1-2 times/week during the first month to help it establish its root system; once established, it should be watered thoroughly whenever the soil feels dry. Water slowly and deeply, and avoid wetting the leaves. When mature, this plant type prefers about 1 inch of water per week (either from rain or manual watering)."

This species grows best in bright, full sunlight and will perform best when exposed to natural sunlight; however, it can also tolerate partial shade if necessary. The plant also may benefit from afternoon shade in regions with intense afternoon sun."

          "description": "Pruning of the Serviceberry (Amelanchier Canadensis 'Glenn Form' RAINBOW PILLAR) should be done once a year in late winter or early spring. This will help the plant maintain a more even shape and structure. When pruning, focus on removing any broken, diseased or dead wood, as well as any crossing branches or branches that are too large for the plantâ€™s structure. If any suckers have developed at the base of the plant, these can also be removed. Pruning should be kept light, and only remove up to 1/3 of the total growth from the plant. This type of pruning will allow the plant to keep its natural form, while also keeping it healthy and strong."
