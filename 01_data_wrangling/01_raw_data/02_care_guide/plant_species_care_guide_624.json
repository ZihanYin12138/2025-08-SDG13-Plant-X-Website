During the hot and dry months, water more often. During the cooler months when the plant is actively growing, water more frequently. The plants should never be left standing in water. When watering, ensure the water penetrates the soil around the roots."

They should be exposed to at least 6 hours of direct sunlight a day for optimal health and growth. During the hottest parts of the day during the summer months it is beneficial to provide some shading of direct sunlight for chu-lan trees."

Prune lightly to maintain the desired size and shape while avoiding damage to the branch structure. Avoid removing more than 1/3 of new growth. Remove dead, damaged, or crossing branches, and thin out unnecessary branches. If desired, remove lower branches to expose the trunks."
