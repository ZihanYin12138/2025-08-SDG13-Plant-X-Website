Do not allow the soil to become soggy. During periods of very hot summer weather, water up to 2 times per week in the morning. Reduce watering during the winter months as plant growth slows down during this time."

          "description": "Threadleaf giant hyssop grows best in full sun, meaning at least 6 hours of sunlight, preferably during the most intense time of day (around midday). If grown in less than full sunlight, the plant may be weakened and more susceptible to disease and insects. In hotter climates, however, it may benefit from some filtered afternoon shade or morning sun. Itâ€™s important to remember that intense afternoon sun can be too much for the plant in certain climates."

          "description": "Threadleaf giant hyssop can be pruned at any time during the growing season. We recommend pruning it lightly in late winter, just before new growth emerges in spring, then again early in summer to encourage denser bushy growth. In general, prune no more than 1/3 of the plant, removing the tallest stems and branches to encourage horizontal branching and a fuller plant form. If necessary, lightly prune in late summer as well."
