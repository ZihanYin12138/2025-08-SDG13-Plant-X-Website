Water the ivy-leaved maple every 7-10 days, or check the soil moisture every few days and water as needed if it starts to feel dry. During the warmer months, water may be needed more frequently. Make sure to water the ivy-leaved maple at the ground level, and avoid getting the leaves wet."

It can also tolerate some light shade. The ideal amount of sunlight for an ivy-leaved maple is 4-5 hours of direct sun per day. Plants grown in partial shade will not reach their full potential size, but will grow much more slowly, and be prone to more fungal infections."

Prune enough to keep the size and shape of the plant in check to avoid it becoming overly thick or overgrown. Additionally, remove any dead, diseased, or damaged growth as it occurs."
