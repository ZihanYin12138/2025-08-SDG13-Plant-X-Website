          "description": "Yellow giant hyssop plants should be watered moderately. Water the plants when the soil is dry, usually once or twice a week. Ensure that the soil does not remain overly saturated for long periods of time, as this will attract disease and pests. It is also important to check the moisture in the soil with your finger before watering, as overwatering can kill the yellow giant hyssop."

          "description": "Yellow giant hyssop (Agastache nepetoides) requires a minimum of 6-8 hours of direct, unfiltered sunlight per day throughout the growing season. This plant grows best in full sun, although it can tolerate partial shade throughout the day. The amount of direct sunlight the plant receives from mid-morning until late afternoon will help ensure it grows properly and produces plenty of fragrant blooms. It is important to provide the yellow giant hyssop with the proper amount of sunlight, as insufficient light can lead to weak and spindly plants with few or no blooms."

          "description": "Prune yellow giant hyssop (Agastache nepetoides) once a year in early spring or late summer. Pinch off the flower spikes of dead blooms to maintain its bushy appearance. Cut back any tall, straggly stems to just above a node in late summer or early fall. Pruning should be minimal, as too much pruning will take away the plantâ€™s natural grace. Gardeners should aim to remove no more than 1/3 of the stems from the bush each time they prune the plant."
