          "description": "German garlic (Allium senescens 'Blue Eddy') should be watered regularly to encourage growth and flowering. Water when the soil begins to dry. This plant should be watered moderately and only when the soil feels dry 1-2 inches deep. It is important to water deeply when watering to encourage the roots to develop and grow deep. Water whenever the top of the soil begins to feel dry, usually once every 7-10 days. It is important to not overwater because this can lead to root rot or other diseases. Allow the soil to dry out between watering to help promote healthy root growth."

          "description": "German garlic (Allium senescens 'Blue Eddy') needs a minimum of 6 hours of direct sunlight each day for optimal growth. During the peak season of growth, an additional few hours of indirect sunlight can also be beneficial. The plant should be placed in a location where it receives full sun during the morning hours and partial shade in the afternoon. This helps to prevent the leaves from becoming scorched by the intense summer sun."

          "description": "German garlic (Allium senescens 'Blue Eddy') should be pruned once a year in late spring or early summer, in order to encourage healthy growth and promote larger flower heads. To prune, cut off any dead or diseased foliage, along with any flower heads that have already bloomed. Also, trim back some of the foliage around the sides of the plant to encourage its growth in a centralised manner, creating a more balanced look. Make sure to wear gloves when pruning to avoid any irritation from the sap."
