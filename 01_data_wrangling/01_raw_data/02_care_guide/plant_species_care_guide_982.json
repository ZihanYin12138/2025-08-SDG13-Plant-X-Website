          "description": "Wormwood (Artemisia 'Powis Castle') should be watered regularly during the growing season, which is typically in the spring and summer months. Water the plant deeply, allowing the soil to dry out slightly between waterings. Avoid over-watering, as it can cause root rot. During the winter months when the plant is dormant, you can reduce the amount of water you give it. Water only occasionally, about once every 2 weeks. Make sure the soil remains slightly damp but not soggy, as it will cause the plant to die off."

          "description": "Wormwood (Artemisia 'Powis Castle') prefers full sun but will tolerate some light shade. The perfect location for this plant species would be a sunny spot with morning sunlight, partial shade in the afternoon, and no shade late in the evening. The plant should receive approximately 6 hours of direct sunlight each day - more in the summer and less in the winter. In addition, it should receive indirect sunlight for at least 4 hours in the morning and 4 hours in the afternoon."

          "description": "Wormwood (Artemisia 'Powis Castle') should be pruned annually in late winter or early spring before new growth begins. Pruning should be done sparingly, removing only dead, damaged, or diseased tissue, or any stems necessary to improve the overall shape and form of the plant. Clip the stems down to just above a healthy bud (a swollen area on the stem from where the new growth will emerge). After the pruning is finished, give the plant a light trim to remove any remaining dead or damaged growth."
