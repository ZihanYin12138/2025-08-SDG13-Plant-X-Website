          "description": "Apple serviceberry plants should receive at least 6 hours of direct sunlight each day for optimum bloom. However, as a versatile species, it is tolerant of a variety of light conditions. Morning sunlight is ideal, to limit damage from intense afternoon sun. For most of the growing season, it should receive full sun from mid-morning to late afternoon. During the hottest summer months, some afternoon shade may be beneficial."

Pruning should be minimal to moderate, removing any broken, dead, or diseased branches/stems, as well as thinning and shaping the canopy of the tree. No more than 1-third of the plant's branches should be pruned at 1 time so as to not stress the plant."
