          "description": "Philippine evergreen should be watered every 1-2 weeks, depending on the season and temperature. During the summer, the plant should be watered more often. During the winter, when the days are shorter, the plant should be watered less often. Philippine evergreen also enjoys evenly moist soil. The best way to ensure this is to water the plant deeply until water seeps out of the bottom of the pot, being careful to avoid over-watering to prevent root rot."

          "description": "The Philippine evergreen requires about 4 to 5 hours of sunlight each day for optimal growth. It requires indirect light for the best results, as direct sunlight can be too harsh for the plant. During the hottest times of the day, the Philippine evergreen should be kept out of direct sunlight. If possible, position this plant near a bright, sunny east or west-facing window. The direct sunlight should come from the morning, afternoon, or early evening and decrease in intensity as the day progresses."

The goal should to be to keep the plant healthy and attractive, so try to only cut off what is necessary. Make sure to use sharp pruners and sanitize them before and after use to avoid any spread of disease. For bigger plants, prune up to 1-third of the canopy."
