          "description": "Golden marguerite (Anthemis tinctoria 'Moonlight') should be watered when the top inch of soil feels dry. This typically happens about once a week, depending on the temperature and humidity in the environment. During hot days, the plant may need to be watered twice per week. However, during cooler days, it may only need to be watered once every 2 weeks. Avoid over-watering the plant, as this can cause root rot. If the soil stays constantly moist, root rot can occur very quickly."

For optimal growth, the plant should receive 6 to 8 hours of full sun per day, ideally concentrated in the morning and afternoon hours. In areas with extreme heat and high temperatures, it is best to provide the plant with partial shade in the afternoon hours to help protect from scorching."

          "description": "Golden marguerite (Anthemis tinctoria 'Moonlight') should be pruned once or twice a year. For optimal growth, before the plant blooms in early summer, you should prune off any old or dead flower heads, as well as any dead or diseased stems. For a more natural look, lightly shear the entire plant in late fall or in late winter, before new growth begins. When pruning, you should remove only 1/3 of the total height, and take care to preserve the natural shape and size of the plant."
