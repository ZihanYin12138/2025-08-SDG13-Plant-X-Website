          "description": "The Caucasian fir needs to be watered regularly to ensure healthy growth. Water the plant deeply 1 to 2 times a week, depending on the temperature and humidity levels. During the hot summer months, water once a week unless soil is very dry, then water twice a week. In cooler temperatures, watering once every 2 weeks is sufficient. Water around the base of the tree, allowing seepage into the soil. Avoid overhead watering, especially during warmer temperatures as this can damage delicate needles and buds. When in doubt, water deeply but less frequently."

          "description": "Caucasian firs (Abies nordmanniana) thrive in full sun to partial shade. In sunnier climates, they will do best in full sun, whereas in cooler climates they may need some protection from the strong afternoon sunshine. Ideally, the Caucasian fir should receive about 4 to 6 hours of direct sunlight each day, preferably in the morning. When grown in shade, the foliage will be much darker and it may not grow to its full potential."

          "description": "Caucasian fir (Abies nordmanniana) is an attractive evergreen conifer that requires regular pruning to maintain its shape and health. Pruning should be carried out in early spring, before the new buds break or during the late spring/early summer. It is recommended to prune 1/3 of the treeâ€™s foliage each year and concentrate mostly on older branches and foliage. Remove branches and stems that are crossing, growing inward, or dead and dying (these can be identified by their brown needles). Pruning should be done carefully and the branch or stem should be cut as close to the entrance of the side branch or stem as possible to avoid leaving a long stub. It is also important to change the direction of the trim slightly each year to encourage more dense growth and prevent an unnatural or lopsided look."
