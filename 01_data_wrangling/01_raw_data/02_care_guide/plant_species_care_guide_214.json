If there is no rainfall, increase the watering frequency. Make sure the soil is moist but never soggy; if the soil is constantly wet, the tree’s roots may become waterlogged and rot. In the fall and winter, reduce watering to once every other week or so as the tree goes dormant."

It is important only to make small pruning cuts that angle away from the plant’s center to prevent the spread of disease. Pruning should be done every few years, depending on the size and condition of the tree."
