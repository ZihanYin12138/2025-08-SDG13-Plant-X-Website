          "description": "Red maple (Acer rubrum 'Brandywine') grows best with regular watering. During the growing season, from spring to fall, water the root zone deeply and allow it to dry out slightly between waterings. You may water your Red Maple every 5 to 7 days. Water 1-1.5 inches of water. During the winter, water less often, but more deeply when you do water, allowing the root zone to dry out for longer periods."

          "description": "Red maple (Acer rubrum 'Brandywine') performs best with full sun to partial shade. It prefers at least 6 hours of direct sunlight each day. Morning sunlight is best, as the afternoon sun can be particularly intense and cause damage. During the summer season, Red maple should receive plenty of indirect sunlight and shade to protect its leaves from drying out. Red maple will also benefit from light filtering through trees or bushes."

          "description": "Red Maple (Acer rubrum 'Brandywine') should generally be pruned during the late winter months, when the tree is dormant and not actively growing. Pruning during the dormant season helps encourage new growth in the spring and can be beneficial to the health of the tree. Pruning should take place when the tree is young and then again every few years thereafter. Pruning should be done selectively, removing dead, damaged, or diseased branches, as well as any branches that are crossing or growing toward the center of the tree. Also, prune any branches that are growing too much beyond the desired shape of the tree. The pruning should be no more than 1/3 of the tree's total growth each year."
