          "description": "Watering for Large Chimanimani Aloe (Aloe munchii) should be done once to twice a week, depending on the dryness of the soil. Ensure that the soil is well-draining so that the water does not stay in the soil for too long, or else the roots may get waterlogged and rot. When watering, use about 1 gallon (4 liters) of water for every 4 square feet (1 square meter) of soil, ensuring that the soil is evenly moistened without getting soggy. It is also important not to over-water as this can lead to root rot and plant death."

          "description": "Large Chimanimani Aloe (Aloe munchii) is a hardy succulent that should be pruned at certain times to encourage healthy growth. It should be pruned in the late summer to early fall months, when the temperatures and light intensity are milder and the plant has ample time to regrow. It is best to lightly prune the tips of the leaves to remove any dead or damaged material. Pruning large quantities of the plant should be avoided, as it can undermine the plantâ€™s health. Pruning too often can also hinder the growth and reduce the size of the plant. If done correctly, pruning can help the Large Chimanimani Aloe reach its fullest potential."
