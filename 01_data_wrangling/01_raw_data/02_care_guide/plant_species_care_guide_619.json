In hot and humid conditions, water every 3-4 days. In dry and arid conditions, water more often and increase the amount of water with each application. Soil should be kept moist but not soggy. Overwatering can be just as damaging as not enough so make sure the soil is allowed to dry out a bit between waterings."

          "description": "White snakeroot should be pruned back to the ground in late winter to early spring. Pruning will create an overall pleasing shape, safeguard against diseases, and encourage new blooms. When pruning, use sharp anvil pruners to avoid crushing stems, and remove all dead and diseased branches. Remove any shoots that are growing too close to the center of the plant to promote air circulation. Make all cuts near a leaf node or bud, and never leave a stub. Finally, be sure not to remove more than 1/3 of the plantâ€™s overall structure when pruning."
