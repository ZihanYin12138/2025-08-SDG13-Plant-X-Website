          "description": "Watering a Nodding Onion (Allium cernuum) plant species should be done regularly. During the growing season, the soil should be kept moist but not soggy. Aim to water deeply at least once per week, depending on the weather conditions in your garden. During drier months, increase watering sessions to twice per week. When watering, direct the stream of water to the soil near the base of the plant to avoid wetting the foliage. Allow the soil to dry out between watering sessions. During the winter, the plant needs less water and should only be watered sparingly."

          "description": "Nodding onion (Allium cernuum) is native to North America and and prefers full-sun to light shade. It grows best in moist to dry soils in a well-draining environment. As a perennial, nodding onion will require at least 6 hours of sunlight per day to be healthy and thrive. During the hot summer months, it is best to provide it with some shade to prevent the foliage from scorching in the sun. The best time of the day to provide it with sunlight is the morning and early afternoon, as this time is much cooler than the late afternoon. During cloudy days, the plant will still benefit from light exposure so as long as there are some breaks in the clouds throughout the day."

          "description": "When it comes to pruning the nodding onion (Allium cernuum), it's best to prune the flower stems just after the seeds have formed in late summer. This encourages further flower production and helps to keep the plant looking neat and tidy. Pruning should be done by cutting the stems back to low points just above the ground. Any dead or diseased foliage should be removed completely. It's best to prune only once or twice per year to avoid damaging the plant. If done correctly, the nodding onion should stay vigorous and keep producing flowers every year."
