          "description": "Camellias (Camellia japonica) should be watered regularly to maintain beautiful, glossy foliage and gorgeous blooms. How much and how often you need to water depends on a few factors. \n\nIn general, Camellias prefer a moist, well-drained soil, but should not be allowed to remain soggy for long periods of time. Water deeply and thoroughly when the top inch or 2 of soil is dry - about once a week in the warm season and once every 2 weeks in winter. During periods of prolonged drought, Camellias may need to be watered every 4 of 5 days.\n\nCamellias should never be allowed to dry out completely. Watering in the morning is best, to give the leaves time to dry before nightfall. Water will be readily available to the plants’ roots, and will seep through the soil allowing air to reach the roots. Also avoid wetting the foliage to prevent blothces and spots. \n\nAdditionally, a layer of mulch can help keep the soil moist and moder the soil temperature. Applying a 3-inch layer of mulch can help conserve moisture and prevent weeds from growing around the base of your Camellia. "

          "description": "Camellia (Camellia japonica) requires bright, indirect sunlight for at least 4 to 6 hours everyday. It can tolerate full sun during morning or evening hours, but should be shaded from the harsh midday sunlight. During the summer, it's best to place the Camellia in an area that receives morning sun and afternoon shade. In the winter months, the Camellia can be moved to a brighter location with full or partial sun exposure."

          "description": "Camellia japonicas should be pruned during late winter or early spring before the plant begins to produce new buds. This species of plant responds well to pruning and should have at least 3 months of slumbering before flowering. Begin by removing any narrow, upright branches with twiggy ends, as well as any dead or damaged wood. The plant can then be shaped to the desired form or kept with a more natural form. Moderate thinning of the stems is also beneficial. Prune away shoots that cross over 1 another, rub against each other, or grow inward to create a more open form. When pruning, remove only ¼ to 1/3 of the stems at 1 time. If more intensive pruning is required, spread the cuts out over a few years."
