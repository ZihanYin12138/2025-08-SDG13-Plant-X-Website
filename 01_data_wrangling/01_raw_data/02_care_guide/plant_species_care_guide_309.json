          "description": "Dwarf Japanese garden Juniper should be watered thoroughly but not excessively. About once a week in the summer months, and once every two weeks in the winter months, is a good rule of thumb. During very hot weather, you may need to water the Dwarf Japanese garden Juniper a bit more, but make sure the soil is completely dry before watering again. To check if the soil is dry, insert your finger into the soil up to the first knuckle. If the top inch or two of soil feels dry, your Juniper needs water."

          "description": "Dwarf Japanese Garden Juniper (tree form) (Juniperus procumbens 'Nana (tree form)) prefers full sun but can tolerate light shade. This plant will do best with at least 6 hours of direct light per day and should be kept out of extreme cold. To provide optimal growing conditions, it should be placed in an area that receives sunlight for the majority of the day. Because this plant prefers well-drained soil, it is recommended that it be placed in a spot that is subject to regular irrigation. When planted in the proper environment, this plant will grow slowly but steadily and can reach heights of up to 12 feet tall."

          "description": "Dwarf Japanese garden Juniper should be pruned once or twice a year in late spring or early summer, to encourage maximum growth and to shape it into a desired shape. Pruning should be done lightly, focusing on removing dead stems and removing overcrowded branches. Pruning should not exceed 1/3 of the original size. Pruning should aim to open up the canopy as much as possible, to allow light and air to enter. Pruning within the year may result in late-season growth and should be avoided."
