          "description": "Windflower plants should be watered moderately but often. Watering should be done once a week, or whenever the soil feels dry to the touch. When watering, take care to moisten the soil thoroughly, and allow any excess water to completely drain away. During the summer months, more frequent watering may be necessary. Avoid overwatering, as this can cause the plant to become prone to root rot and diseases."

          "description": "Windflower needs 6-8 hours of direct sunlight and 4-5 hours of partial shade every day. It should be placed in an area that receives plenty of morning sunlight and filter afternoon sun. During summer, avoid exposing windflower to intense afternoon sun as it may cause scorching and irreversible damage to its foliage. It prefers the cooler and breezier air of late spring and early fall days for optimal growth."

          "type": "pruning",
          "description": "Windflower (Anemone lesseri) should be pruned immediately after they finish flowering, typically in late spring or early summer. You should cut back the old stems to a set of healthy buds no more than 1/3 of the way from the stem's base, as cutting back any more further down may prevent new growth from appearing. New stems should be removed to maintain an even shape. This species may require a hard prune each year in order to ensure a steady supply of new blooms and remove any dead stems."
