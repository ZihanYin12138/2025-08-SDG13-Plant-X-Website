          "description": "Lily of the Incas (Alstroemeria 'Jupiter') should be watered regularly throughout the growing season so as to keep the soil lightly moist but not soggy. Check the soil every 1-2 days and water when the top 2-3 inches of soil are dry. Water thoroughly so that the water reaches the deepest roots, and then allow the soil to drain before refilling the pot. During peak growing season, Lilies of the Incas can usually be watered every few days, back off watering slightly during the cooler fall and winter months."

          "description": "Lily of the Incas (Alstroemeria 'Jupiter') needs plenty of sunlight in order to thrive. It should receive at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight each day, preferably from mid-morning to early afternoon. Shade during hot afternoons is beneficial for this plant. If possible, avoid placing the plant in direct sunlight during the hottest parts of the day, especially between 12 noon and 3pm."

          "description": "Lily of the Incas (Alstroemeria 'Jupiter') should be pruned twice a year, in early spring and late summer-early fall. In early spring, prune the plant back by up to 1/3 of its total height. This will help to keep the plant looking bushy and healthy, and it will also encourage bushier, more abundant blooming. In late summer-early fall, remove any spent flowers and resultant seedpods. This will keep the plant looking neat and tidy while also promoting more flowers."
