The soil should stay moist but not soggy; allow the top 2 to 3 inches of soil to dry out before deeply watering. Drought-like conditions may cause the plant to shed some leaves. "

          "description": "Variegated kiwi vine (Actinidia kolomikta) should be pruned annually in late winter or very early spring before any new growth emerges. Pruning should involve removing dead or weak stems, as well as thinning out stems that are densely packed together to help promote better air circulation and light penetration to the inner leaves on the vine. About 1/3to 1/2 of the vine canopy should be removed, cutting back the stems to where 2 healthy buds are present. This will help to encourage more abundant blooms, new foliage, and overall vine growth."
