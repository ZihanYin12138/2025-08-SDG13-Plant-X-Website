In the hottest periods of summer, watering may need to occur slightly more often. Ensure the soil is thoroughly moistened, but donâ€™t let the soil become soggy. If the soil has dried out too much, a deep soaking may be in order. When watering, pay attention to the leaves and pay special attention to any areas that may not be receiving sufficient moisture."

          "description": "Red Flowering Dogwood (Cornus florida 'var. rubra') requires at least 4 hours of direct sunlight each day, up to 8 hours being ideal. This type of dogwood prefers moist and slightly acidic soil, and should be planted in locations that receive full sun in the morning and light shade in the afternoon. This will help to prevent scorching from the sun."
