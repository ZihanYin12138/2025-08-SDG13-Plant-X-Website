          "description": "It is best to water the plant slowly and deeply during the summer months in order to encourage the root system to develop properly. Aim to water once or twice a week, depending on how dry the soil is, and allowing the top few inches of soil to dry out between waterings. In winter, the plant should only be watered occasionally and very sparingly, about once a month."

          "description": "It needs about 6-8 hours of direct sunlight for best results. It can also flourish in part sun, meaning 4-6 hours of direct sunlight per day. However, during hot summer months, this plant species will benefit from some midday shade to protect it from the heat."

          "description": "The Seiryu Japanese Maple (Acer palmatum 'Seiryu') should be pruned twice a year – once in early spring and then again in midsummer. Pruning in early spring should focus on removing any dead or diseased branches, as well as cutting out any unruly or crossing branches. Pruning in the midsummer should mainly focus on thinning the tree out and reducing the tree’s overall size or desired shape. Be sure to only remove 1/3 or no more than 1/4 of the tree's branches to maintain its health. When pruning, use clean, sharp tools and make sure to dip them in rubbing alcohol or a bleach solution to prevent any spread of disease."
