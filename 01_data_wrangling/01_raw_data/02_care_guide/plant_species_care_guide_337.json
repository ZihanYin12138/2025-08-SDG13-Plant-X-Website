Soak the soil with a slow trickle of water for several minutes, until the water flows through to the base of the pot. Allow the top layer of soil to dry before watering again. In periods of extreme heat, you may need to increase watering frequency. "

          "description": "Yellow Bird Magnolia should be pruned in late winter or early spring, before the flowers bloom, to keep it looking its best. Pruning should be light, with no more than 1-third of the branch and stem growth removed in any 1 season. It is best to prune out any weak, dead, or damaged branches first, then thin out the remaining growth to create a balanced shape. If the plant has become overgrown, sound specialist advice should be taken before any major pruning is carried out."
