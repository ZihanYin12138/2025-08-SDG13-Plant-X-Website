          "description": "Watering frequency and amount for Moonrise Full Moon Maple should be moderate. Aim to keep the soil evenly moist most of the time, but never soggy or waterlogged. During the spring and summer months when the plant is actively growing, water deeply once or twice a week to a depth of 12-15 inches. During the fall and winter months when the plant is not actively growing, water only when the top inch or 2 of soil feels dry to the touch. If your soil is sandy, you may have to water more often, while if it is clay-like, you may need to water less often."

          "description": "This species is best suited for growing in part-shade, with exposure to 4 to 6 hours of direct sunlight each day. Ideally, the Moonrise Full Moon Maple should be exposed to early morning sunlight, followed by diffuse, indirect light in the mid- to late afternoon."

          "type": "pruning",
          "description": "For the Moonrise Full Moon Maple, pruning should be done in early to mid-spring when new leaves start to appear. You should prune only the dead, damaged, and diseased branches and never more than 1/3 of the total branches on the tree. Pruning should be done carefully to preserve the natural shape of the tree. Try to prune the branches that cross each other, as well as those that are too close together. If you prune correctly, it will improve the tree's health and vigor, and even encourage new growth."
