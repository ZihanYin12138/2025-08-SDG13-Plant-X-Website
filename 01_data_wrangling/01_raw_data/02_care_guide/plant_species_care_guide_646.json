          "description": "Bugleweed (Ajuga reptans 'Toffee Chip') should be watered weekly, using enough water to thoroughly moisten the soil. Allow the top inch of soil to dry out in between waterings. During particularly hot weather, water more frequently, aiming to keep the soil slightly moist but not soaked. It is important to avoid overwatering, which can damage the plant or lead to fungal diseases."

          "description": "Bugleweed (Ajuga reptans 'Toffee Chip') does best when it is placed in an area that receives at least 4 to 6 hours of sunlight each day. The plant should not be placed in direct sunlight for extended periods, as the plant will become scorched. The plant should not be placed in total shade, either, as it won't be able to access the proper amount of light it needs to grow and thrive. It's best to keep Bugleweed in an area that receives indirect morning sunlight and indirect early afternoon sunlight, or the sun should be filtered through a thin curtain or light tree cover."

          "description": "Bugleweed (Ajuga reptans 'Toffee Chip') is a fast-growing perennial ground-cover that reaches 6-8 inches in height and spreads quickly. It blooms in spring and summer with attractive spikes of purple flowers. For best results, prune bugleweed in mid to late summer once the plant finishes flowering. Pruning will help to encourage more branching and fuller growth, as well as help to reduce the spread of the plant. Remove any dead, damaged, or diseased foliage, as well as any weak or spindly shoots that aren't producing flowers. Prune off up to 1/3 of the plant without damaging the root system. You can also trim any stems that have grown too long and are overcrowding other plants. Be careful not to over prune, as bugleweed can become leggy and sparse."
