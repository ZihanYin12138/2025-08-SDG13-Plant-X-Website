When watering, moisten the soil completely and make sure that the excess water drains out of the pot. During hot weather, water more frequently, approximately every 3-4 days. In the winter, reduce watering to about every 10 days while the plant is dormant. Always avoid overwatering and allow the plant to dry out moderately in between waterings."

Do not prune too heavily as this can cause damage to the plant and reduce the amount of flowers it will produce. If excessive pruning is needed, it can be done gradually over several weeks, removing no more than 1-third of the plant at a time."
