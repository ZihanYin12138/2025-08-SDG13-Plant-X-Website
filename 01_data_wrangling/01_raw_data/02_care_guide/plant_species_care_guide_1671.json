          "description": "It is important to keep Carex siderosticha 'Shima-nishiki' ISLAND BROCADE well-watered. Water the plant deeply every week throughout the growing season from early spring until late fall. During hot and dry weather, the plant may need to be watered more often. In winter, no water is needed, as this type of sedge prefers dry winters. To check if it needs more water, stick your finger into the soil near the base of the plant to a depth of 2-3 inches. If the soil is too dry, water deeply until water runs out of the bottom of the pot. Make sure to drain any excess water from the saucer."

          "description": "In full sun to part shade, Carex siderosticha 'Shima-nishiki' Island Brocade should receive at least 4 hours of direct sunlight or bright, indirect sunlight each day. Too much direct sun may cause the foliage to scorch and sunburn, so some afternoon shade may be beneficial."

          "description": "Prune Carex siderosticha 'Shima-nishiki' ISLAND BROCADE to remove any dead, damaged, or diseased foliage, along with any browning stalks. It's a good practice to perform general maintenance pruning 2 to 3 times per growing season. In spring, prune 1/3 of the older/taller foliage all the way to the ground. Then, prune again mid-summer to shape and remove any dead foliage. In late summer/early fall, prune a final time, taking off any further dead or damaged foliage. Additionally, if your sedge ISLAND BROCADE starts to sprawl a bit too much, you can prune it in autumn to trim up the edges. By using the right pruning techniques, you can enjoy beautiful foliage throughout the growing season!"
