          "description": "Watering giant cane bamboo should be done regularly and thoroughly. When watering, use lukewarm water to provide as much moisture as possible for the plant. Deep irrigation is important to keep the roots fully hydrated. Water thoroughly once or twice a week in summer and spring, and once every 2 weeks in fall and winter. Make sure to water the soil into the root zone and not just along the stems and foliage."

          "description": "Giant Cane Bamboo plants (Arundinaria gigantea) should be kept in an area with at least 6 hours of direct sunlight each day. The best amount of sunlight for this plant species is 8 to 10 hours of direct sunlight daily for optimum growth. Full shade will hinder its growth and cause the cane stems to become sparse and weak. Giant cane bamboo is a warm weather plant and can be damaged in cooler temperatures. It will thrive in a warmer climate with a temperature which doesn't drop below 0 Degrees Celsius."

          "description": "Giant cane bamboo should be pruned once a year, in the early spring before the growing season begins. Pruning your giant cane bamboo should be done by cutting off up to 1/4 of the culmâ€™s length, leaving at least 6 to 8 inches of the upper part of the culm intact. This should be done carefully and with clean pruning tools to prevent damage to the plant. If you would like to thin out the canes to encourage new growth, it is best to remove the oldest stalks at soil level."
