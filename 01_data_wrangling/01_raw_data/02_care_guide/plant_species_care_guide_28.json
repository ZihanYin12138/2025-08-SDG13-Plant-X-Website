          "description": "Aka Shigitatsu Sawa Japanese Maples (Acer palmatum 'Aka Shigitatsu Sawa') should be watered deeply twice a week during the spring and summer months, and once a week during the fall and winter months. When watering, it is important to saturate the ground thoroughly to a depth of 1-2 feet. As the plants become established, they become more tolerant of dryness, and therefore require less frequent watering. Additionally, make sure to avoid overwatering by stopping when water starts to run off."

          "description": "Aka Shigitatsu Sawa Japanese Maple prefers bright, indirect sunlight. The ideal location for this plant species is an area that receives around 4 hours of sunlight in the morning and 4 hours of sunshine in the afternoon (with some filtered or shade in between). For areas with full sun, the plant should have limited exposure during the peak hours of the day and some shade during the middle of the day to reduce the intensity of the sunâ€™s rays."

          "description": "Pruning of the Aka Shigitatsu Sawa Japanese Maple (Acer palmatum 'Aka Shigitatsu Sawa') should be done in moderation in order to preserve the desired natural beauty of the plant. Pruning should be done during the dormant season in late winter or early spring, before new growth begins. Pruning should focus on maintaining the desired size and shape of the plant, removing any dead, dying, or diseased wood, thin out overly dense foliage, and tidy up the overall appearance of the plant. Prune lightly, removing no more than 1/3 of the existing foliage each time."
