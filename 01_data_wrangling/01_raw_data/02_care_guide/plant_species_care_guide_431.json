          "description": "Water Black Cat Claw (Acacia redolens) plants regularly but lightly. Allow the soil to dry slightly between waterings, about every 7 to 10 days depending on the weather. Water when the soil is dry about 2 inches (5 cm) deep. Do not allow the soil to become overly dry or soggy. Check the soil by inserting a finger into the soil to the first knuckle, then water if the soil is dry. In summer, water more frequently, as hot temperatures can dry the soil more quickly. Monitor temperature, rainfall, and soil for signs of moisture loss."

It grows best in warm temperatures and is somewhat frost-sensitive. If temperatures are cold, filtered sunlight should be provided instead. This plant does not do well in heavy shade."

          "description": "For black cat claw (Acacia redolens), it is recommended to prune lightly in late spring. Pruning should be done to reduce overall size, as this plant can grow quite bushy if left unpruned. Remove any dead, diseased, or broken branches, as well as any crossing branches or overly long branches. Remove any branches that are growing downwards or are too close to the ground. Prune no more than 1/3 of the plant at any time, as this will help to maintain the health and shape of the plant. It is also important to use sharp, clean tools to avoid putting too much stress on the plant when pruning."
