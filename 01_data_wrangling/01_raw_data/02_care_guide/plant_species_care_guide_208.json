          "description": "Green Prince Cedar of Lebanon should be watered thoroughly about twice a week during its growing season, from late spring to mid-fall. Watering should be reduced over winter. The soil should remain moist, but not wet or saturated. Water until it starts to drip out of the drainage holes. Avoid giving the plant too much water otherwise root rot can occur. During periods of extreme heat, it may need more regular watering. During winter months, water only when the soil begins to dry out and the plant looks wilted."

This tree prefers a sunny spot that receives at least 80% of direct sunlight throughout the day. During winter, it should receive full sun during the morning hours, followed by midday shade during the afternoon hours. During the summer, this tree prefers full sun for the majority of the day."

          "description": "Green Prince Cedar of Lebanon (Cedrus libani 'Green Prince') should be pruned in late winter to early spring just before the new growth starts. This helps to encourage a natural and balanced shape, while maintaining size. You should only remove dead or damaged branches and dead or diseased growth. Pruning should generally be fairly light, limiting pruning of healthy material to no more than 1/4  of the live foliage. This ensures that the plant retains its natural shape and good health. If cedars become overgrown, they can be cut back to desirable sizes if needed. However, it is important to remember that over-pruning may result in thinning branches and stunted growth."
