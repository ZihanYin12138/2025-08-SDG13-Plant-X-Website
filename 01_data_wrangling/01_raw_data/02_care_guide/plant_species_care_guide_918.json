          "description": "Arbutus andrachnoides, or the hybrid strawberry tree, needs to be watered regularly to remain healthy. In general, it is best to water the plant once per week, and each watering should provide about 1 inch of water. Water the plant deeply, so that the soil is moist a few inches below the surface. In the summer months, the plant may need to be watered more often if grown in a sunny area. In the colder months, the water needs of the plant will be reduced. Always be sure to test the soil moisture by sticking your finger in the soil to a depth of a few inches. If the soil feels dry when you test it, it is time to water."

          "description": "The hybrid strawberry tree needs a lot of sunlight for it to thrive and bear fruit - ideally around 6-8 hours of direct sunlight every day. It should receive morning sun and some shade during the afternoon. To maximize growth, pruning should be done in late winter or early spring. The plant also requires some shelter during the winter months when temperatures drop. Additionally, it should be planted in soil that is well-draining and slightly acidic. With proper care, the hybrid strawberry tree can produce fruit in the spring and summer."

          "description": "Hybrid strawberry tree (Arbutus andrachnoides) should be pruned annually between fall and early spring. Pruning should start early and deal with larger branches first. It is important to always remove the branches completely and not to leave stubs behind to help keep the shape of the tree. Young trees should have very light trimming and pruning and only major dead branches should be removed. As the plant matures, minor pruning can be done in order to control the shape and size of the plant. Pruning should be done judiciously to ensure the branch structure of the tree stays balanced and attractive."
