          "description": "The Chinese astilbe (Astilbe chinensis 'Purpurkerze' PURPLE CANDLE) should be watered deeply and infrequently. Aim to water your astilbe once or twice a week during the growing season (spring and summer). Make sure the top 2-3 inches of soil feel slightly moist but not overly saturated. During cooler, Winter months, water less often, aiming to moisten the earth with every 2-3 weeks. Always check the soil around the roots before watering, as adding too much water can cause root rot."

Morning sun is ideal, since this plant doesnâ€™t do well in hot afternoon sun. If it does receive too much sunlight, its foliage may scorch or bleached."

The fade flower heads should be cut back to the leaf base of each clump and dead foliage should be removed. Cut back the foliage as needed to maintain good air circulation and light penetration. Additionally, Chinese astilbe can be divided every 4-5 years in the spring to help promote fresh foliage and blooms."
