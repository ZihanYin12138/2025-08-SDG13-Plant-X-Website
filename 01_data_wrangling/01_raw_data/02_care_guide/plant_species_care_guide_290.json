          "description": "Mission Fig plants need to be watered when the top 1-2 inches of soil feels dry. They should be watered deeply and thoroughly, allowing enough water to drain through the bottom of the pot. Watering once or twice a week should be sufficient, and during the winter you can water less often. Make sure the soil is not soggy or overly wet, as this can cause root rot."

          "description": "Mission Fig plants prefer full sun and will grow best when they receive at least 8 hours of sunlight each day. Depending on the climate and latitude, this amount may vary slightly, but the general rule of thumb is that they should receive at least 8 hours of direct sun each day. In areas that get very hot during the summer months, it may be beneficial to provide some shade for the plant in the afternoon to help prevent sunburn or leaf scorch. Additionally, if you are growing Mission Fig in a container, you should take into account the amount of light it will receive throughout the day and rotate the container regularly to ensure that all parts of the plant receive the right amount of sun."

          "description": "Mission Fig should be pruned twice a year; once in late winter and once again in August. Pruning should not be done once the fig tree has fruited. During winter pruning, the goal should be to reduce the height of the tree while retaining the width and shape of the canopy. The tree should be cut back to about 1/3 or 1/2 of its original height and any dead, diseased, or unproductive branches should be removed. In August, pruning should be done to thin out the canopy by removing any crossing branches or branches that rub against each other, as well as any overcrowded branches. Removal of new shoots should allow more air and sunlight to enter the canopy. Pruning should also remove excess foliage, limbs, and suckers."
