          "description": "Rose Marie Magnolia plants should be watered on a regular basis and are relatively drought tolerant. During their growing season (April to August), they should be watered deeply but less often, approximately every 10 days to 2 weeks. During the dormant season (September to March), water less frequently, approximately once a month. The soil should be kept moist but well-drained. They respond well to a light application of fertilizer in the spring."

          "description": "Rose Marie Magnolia (Magnolia 'Rose Marie') does best in full sun, meaning it should receive at least 6 to 8 hours of direct sunlight every day. It should be planted in a spot with good air circulation and preferably in a location where it will not be sheltered by any taller trees or buildings, as this can shield it from optimal sun exposure and can also lead to a risk of disease. In the warmer months, it will benefit from morning sun followed by filtered light for the rest of the day. In the winter months when the angle of the sun is lower, it should receive as much direct sunlight as possible."

          "type": "pruning",
          "description": "Rose Marie Magnolia should be pruned lightly in early spring, just before or as new growth begins. This light pruning helps to remove any dead or diseased branches and encourages the development of a strong, attractive framework. Be careful to remove only dead, weak, or diseased branches, and never more than 1/3 of the total structure. Generally, pruning should not be undertaken more than once every few years. It is important not to prune too much or too aggressively, as this can severely damage the plant and decrease its lifespan."
