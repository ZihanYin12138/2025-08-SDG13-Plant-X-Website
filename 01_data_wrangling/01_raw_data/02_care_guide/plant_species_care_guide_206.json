          "description": "Kashmir Deodar Cedar (Cedrus deodara 'Kashmir') should be watered frequently, especially during the hot summer months. During spring and summer, water the plant deeply at least once a week. Increase frequency to twice a week during periods of hot, dry weather. During the winter months, reduce watering to once every 2 to 3 weeks, depending on the weather conditions. Check soil moisture before watering by sticking your finger in the potting soil up to the second finger joint. When the soil feels slightly dry, it's time to give the plant a deep watering. Avoid over-watering, as this can cause root rot."

          "description": "Kashmir Deodar Cedar (Cedrus deodara 'Kashmir') is generally a slow-growing tree, so it requires minimal pruning. Pruning should be done in late winter, preferably after January, when the tree is in its dormancy period. It is important to prune only dead, dying, or broken branches using clean, sharp pruning tools. When pruning, take care to make clean cuts just above the branch collar. Avoid removing more than 25% of the tree’s foliage and try to prune in a way that preserves the plant’s natural shape."
