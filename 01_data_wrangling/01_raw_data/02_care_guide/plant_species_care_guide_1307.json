          "description": "The Red Silk Cottontree needs to be watered deeply twice a week, providing 1-1.5 inches of water. When watering, be sure to saturate the soil thoroughly and make sure to water directly at the root zone. Depending on seasonal weather conditions, more or less frequent watering may be required - be sure to look for signs of drought stress, such as wilting leaves and dry soil, to determine if your Red Silk Cottontree needs to be watered or not. Additionally, water slowly over a large area to ensure itâ€™s absorbed properly. Lastly, check the soil periodically and make sure it is not water-logged."

          "description": "Red silk cottontrees should be pruned twice a year in the late spring and early fall. In the first pruning, which should take place in late spring, remove any damaged, diseased, or dead branches and stems. You should also reduce the overall size of the tree by making selective pruning cuts. For the second pruning, which should take place in early fall, prune off any new shoots and branches that are obstructing paths or walkways. Pruning should be done sparingly and with care to avoid damaging the tree."
