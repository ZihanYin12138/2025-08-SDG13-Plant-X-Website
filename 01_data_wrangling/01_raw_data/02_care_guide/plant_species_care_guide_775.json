          "description": "Blue Star (Amsonia 'Blue Ice') requires regular watering, with about 1 inch of water per week to keep the soil moist. Water thoroughly when the soil begins to dry out, making sure to water the entire root structure. Avoid overwatering, as this can kill the plant. Water preferably in the morning or evening to limit the potential for water loss from evaporation. During the summer, you may need to increase the frequency of watering due to higher temperatures and increased evaporation. It's best to check the soil moisture level to ensure that you are not overwatering the plant."

          "description": "Blue Ice Amsonia is a deciduous plant that prefers full sun to partial shade when being grown outdoors. It does best in areas that receive 6-8 hours of direct sunlight throughout the day, preferably in the morning or early afternoon. This is especially true during the summer months when the plant is the most active. During the winter, the plant may be able to tolerate less direct sunlight, but it still needs bright, indirect sunlight to thrive and flower. If planted in too much shade, the plant can become lanky and leggy."

          "description": "Blue Star (Amsonia 'Blue Ice') should be pruned in late fall or early spring when the plant is still dormant. Pruning can be done lightly, removing no more than 1/3 of the total branches at a time. This will help the plant promote fresh, vigorous growth when it comes out of its dormancy. It is best to prune the plant with sharp, clean tools in order to avoid any harm to the delicate branches."
